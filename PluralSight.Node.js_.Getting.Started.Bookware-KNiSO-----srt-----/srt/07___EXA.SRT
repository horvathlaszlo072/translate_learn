00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,280
light. There are references two folders

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,110
associated with the modules of this

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,630
course. These folders can be found on get

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,839
hub or under the exercise files section.

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,150
Here is the good help repository that I'll

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,059
be using throughout this course. It will

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,480
give us starting points for code templates

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,089
and let us focus our time on concepts

9
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,280
rather than wasting time typing simple

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,010
scripts. This report is hosted under

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,609
GitHub dot com slash gs complete slash n

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,039
gs and GS here is not getting started. You

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,429
can see the different folders for the

14
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,850
different modules right here. The same

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,909
content of this ripa is also available

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,859
under the exercise files on the course

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,439
page. If you don't have access to get up,

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,490
your first step is to clone this repo

19
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,369
locally to your machine. To clone this

20
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,840
repo, copy the NGS repo. You're Ellen here

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,270
and type the following command in your

22
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,289
terminal Get clone the repo your URL. This

23
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,500
will create a directory named NGS under

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,899
your current working directory so seedy

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,829
into this new NGS And in here you can see

26
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,650
the list of numbered folders. Let me open

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,040
up An editor here on this repo. So within

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,659
the top level folders, which are

29
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,469
associated with modules in the course

30
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,730
you'll see folders and files representing

31
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,879
videos of the course module. In order.

32
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,450
However, some of the course videos will

33
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,730
not have folders, and some folders here

34
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,560
might have multiple files representing the

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,530
examples we are going to cover in its

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,390
associated video. The files are usually

37
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,349
numbered in the order off their example in

38
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:33,349
the video and all these files in the NGS

39
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,519
Repo is your starting point for each

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,439
exercise we're going to go through in this

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,140
course. One thing I'd like to point out

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,450
before we begin. This course has many

43
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,120
modules. We use the word module here to

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,950
describe a section in the course. The word

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,040
module is also heavily used, with note to

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,140
refer to a file or folder of code. To make

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,790
this a little bit less confusing, I will

48
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,790
say course module every time I refer to a

49
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,609
section of the course, So let's jump to

50
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,900
the next course module and get you

51
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,000
properly introduced to the wonderful nauseous Runtime
