[Autogenerated] it's a wrap on this npm

1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,780
course module. We covered a lot of topics

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,059
under npm, but they were really all

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,509
important and will be needed when working

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,650
with node projects. I'd like to remind

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,970
you, though, that npm is just one package

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,980
manager that you can use. There are a few

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,879
others, most notably the yawn project by

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,039
Facebook. The commands for these other

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,929
package managers might be slightly

10
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,339
different, but the concepts are similar.

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,670
Npm is what you get by default when you

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,890
install node, but you can easily switch to

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,039
other managers if you like them better. So

14
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,500
in this module we talked about what is npm

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,130
and why is it needed? UI explored the

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,969
basic commands for working with npm. UI

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,630
discussed the purpose of package that

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,679
Jason and package locked Jason. We learned

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,829
about semantic versioning and how the npm

20
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,780
commands work with them. We learned how to

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,799
locally and globally install npm packages

22
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,950
and how to use these installed packages.

23
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,109
In note, we created a simple npm package

24
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,469
and published that on npm Js dot com. We

25
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,840
learned about using npm X to execute

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,239
locally installed execute herbal npm

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,959
commands on. We saw how to use npm run

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,640
scripts to have a standard way to run and

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,739
test the tasks in a project. And finally

30
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,590
we learned how to check an update your

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,549
project dependency tree in the next

32
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,620
module. We'll talk about the most

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,280
important aspect about no jazz, which is

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,000
how it works with slow operations without blocking other operations.
