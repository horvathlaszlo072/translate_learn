00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,580
[Autogenerated] this module was a quick

1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,750
review of the modern JavaScript features

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,309
that were introduced to the language in

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:08,740
the past few years and are currently

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,169
available natively in note. We've talked

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,289
about block scoops and how they are a bit

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,359
different than function scopes and how

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,460
it's wise to use the let and Const.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,899
Keyword within them. We've seen how error

9
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,480
functions are different than regular

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,260
functions. We've explored the modern ways

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,670
to work with object liberals and talked

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,719
about de structuring and the rest spread

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,989
properties. We saw how to work with

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,950
template strings and how to create and use

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,619
classes, and finally saw an example of

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,890
consuming promises with regular promise.

17
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,640
Centex on with the A sync Await us well.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,890
In the next module, we'll explore the npm

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,329
tool. Npm is notes package manager, and it

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,289
has a website hosting hundreds of

21
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,750
thousands of note packages. We'll explore

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,000
the npm tool itself and talk about some of the most popular npm packages out there
