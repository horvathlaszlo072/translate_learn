[Autogenerated] I hope you are now excited

1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,679
about node. This module has been just a

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,820
teaser about the many powerful features

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,640
that come built into the note or in time.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,240
This includes things like its powerful

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,080
rebel on CLI, and it's built in libraries

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,199
like etc. To-be, which we use to quickly

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,769
create a Web server. It also comes with

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,339
plenty of customizable options and a built

9
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,870
in bridge to the operating system. Through

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,949
the process object, however, UI Onley

11
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,960
scratched the surface in this module.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,989
There are so many other things that I want

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,219
to show you. But before I do, let me make

14
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,130
sure that you are familiar with the modern

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,939
JavaScript features that I'm starting to

16
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,990
use and will continue to do throughout

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,450
this course. This next module will be

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,590
exactly that. A _____ course on all the

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,939
modern JavaScript features that were added

20
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,579
to the language since 2015 and are now

21
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,490
natively available in your node

22
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,439
environment. Features like template

23
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,990
strings, arrow functions, classes, block

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,159
scopes, de structuring promises with a

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,929
sync weight and more. If you're already

26
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,000
familiar with these features, you should skip this next module
