[Autogenerated] One of the common tasks in

1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,599
any backend program is to work with the

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:06,889
operating system resources. Read

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:08,609
information from the U. S. And right

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,300
information to it as well. No, it has a

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,519
few built in modules that provide some

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,160
core features around these tasks. There is

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,579
the OS module for general communication

8
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,870

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,620
is specific to reading and writing to the

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,870
OS file system. And there is also the

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,629
child process module that enables you to

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,780
run any operating system command from

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,000
