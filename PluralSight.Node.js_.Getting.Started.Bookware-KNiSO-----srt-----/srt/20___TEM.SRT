[Autogenerated] template strings are one

1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,450
of my favorite new features that were

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,169
introduced to the JavaScript language a

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,140
few years ago. Let me tell you about them.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,109
You can define a string in JavaScript,

5
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,050
using either single quotes or double

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,810
quotes. Thes two ways to define string.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,539
Liberals and JavaScript are equivalent.

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,850
Modern JavaScript has a third way to

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,500
define strings, and that's using the back

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,210
tick character on my keyboard. It's right

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,379
above the tab. Key strings defined with

12
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,109
the back tick character are called

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,679
template strings because they could be

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,939
used as a template with dynamic values as

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,939
they support what we call interpolation.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,509
You can inject any dynamic expression in

17
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,039
JavaScript within these dollar sign curly

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,780
braces holders. So, for example, we can

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,909
use Matha random here, and the final

20
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,329
string will have the value of the

21
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,719
expression included exactly where it was

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,159
injected in the string. If you test this

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,020
string and note, you'll see a random value

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,990
every time you do it with template

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,200
strings. You can also have multi lines in

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,219
the strings, something that was not

27
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,370
possible with the regularly quoted

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,680
strings. Back text look very similar to

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,870
single quotes, so make sure to train your

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,000
eyes to spot template strings when they are used in examples
