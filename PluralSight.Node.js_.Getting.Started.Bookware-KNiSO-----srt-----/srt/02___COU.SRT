[Autogenerated] Hello. Thanks for tuning

1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,240
in to this course. My name is Sam URL

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,440
Bouna. And this is the no just-as getting

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,009
started course at Pluralsight. This is a

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,890
beginner, of course, for the nauseous from

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,009
time. I won't be assuming that you know

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,890
anything about node. But I will be

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,670
assuming that, you know, the basics of

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,530
programming and a little bit of the

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,570
JavaScript language itself. This course

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,109
has a module about modern JavaScript. But

11
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,429
I do not cover the basic concepts of the

12
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,589
language there. If you've never worked

13
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,519
with JavaScript, IT for this course might

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,399
be a bit challenging for you. And if you

15
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,109
get yourself a bit more familiar with the

16
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,340
JavaScript language itself, this course

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,109
will be a lot easier to digest if you know

18
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,070
JavaScript. But you don't know the modern

19
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,780
JavaScript changes that happened in the

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,780
past few years. That's okay. This module

21
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,689
will get you covered. If you're expecting

22
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,429
this course to make you a professional. No

23
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,899
developer, I need to get your expectation

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,179
straight. This is a short course toe on

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,359
Lee. Get you started on your path to

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,810
learn. Note. It's just a first step. No,

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,729
it is a big framework, with many built in

28
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,670
modules and concepts, which you need to

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,069
learn. But they require much longer time

30
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,379
and bigger effort. This course is designed

31
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,120
to help you get ready for that. Here are

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,909
the main topics covered in this course,

33
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,299
and you can see them here in order. First,

34
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,319
we'll go over some of the core features in

35
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,349
note and how to execute scripts and work

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,569
with the command line. Then we'll do a

37
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,200
review of the modern features in

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,959
JavaScript that you can execute in your

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,349
note yesterday. After that, we'll talk

40
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:30,629
about notes. Package manager npm. Then

41
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,599
probably the most important part about

42
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,760
this course is when we start talking about

43
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,739
modules and note and how note handles slow

44
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,590
operations. Then we'll go over some

45
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,030
examples about working with web servers

46
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,359
and note both natively and with external

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,230
tools. And finally, we'll talk about how

48
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,629
to work with the operating system files on

49
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,109
commands. Ah, lot more features in the

50
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,329
note. A P I will not be covered by this

51
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,879
course. For example, this course will not

52
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,459
cover C plus plus add ons, buffers and

53
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,370
streams, modules like Crypto Z lip, DNA's

54
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,769
Net and di Gram and many others that I

55
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:10,430
classify as Mawr advanced concepts. The

56
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,560
good news is that I created an advanced

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,650
note course here at Pluralsight is well,

58
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,800
so after finishing this getting started

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,650
course, I think he'll be ready to take a

60
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,969
deeper dive and explore the other advanced

61
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,539
concepts that I cover in this advanced no

62
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,710
Jazz course. Here I am recording this

63
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,020
course on a Mac book. If you have a

64
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,009
Windows machine, things are going to be a

65
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,280
bit different for you. Note itself is a

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,210
bit different on Windows than it is on

67
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,960
Linux and Mac. You might run into problems

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,699
that I don't. If you do run into problems

69
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,710
that block your progress in this course,

70
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,030
please don't hesitate to ask for help in

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,810
the discussion section of this course. If

72
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,979
you have a modern Windows machine, one

73
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,810
option that might work a lot better for

74
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,789
you is to install the Windows subsystem

75
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,879
for Linux. This option will give you the

76
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,789
best of both worlds. You'll have your

77
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:00,080
Windows operating system running Linux

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,500
without needing to reboot so you can work

79
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,889
a Linux file system with your Windows

80
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,759
editor, for example, which I think is

81
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,740
great I've tested this option, and I can

82
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,479
confidently say that this will probably be

83
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,550
the future of writing code for node on

84
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,740
Windows. No, it is usually deployed on

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,870
Linux machines and production. So by using

86
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,460
a Linux environment on your Windows

87
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,490
machine, you'll be closer to the way

88
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,930
your-app ligations are running in

89
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,740
production. And that's always a good win.

90
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,870
I often get complains that my Pluralsight

91
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,830
courses are a bit fast, and it's hard for

92
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,210
people to keep up. This is true, and this

93
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,870
course will be no exception. It's not that

94
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,689
I am a fast talker. It's the fact that

95
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,099
these courses are tightly edited with no

96
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,050
breaks. Ah, lot of content is

97
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,840
intentionally jammed into a short course.

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,300
That, however, does not mean that you

99
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,689
can't manually give yourself breaks. The

100
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,180
most important button in the Pluralsight

101
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,569
video player is probably the pause button.

102
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,060
Use it often. For example, every time I

103
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,000
ask question, pause the video and think of

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,180
it every time I use something that you've

105
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,379
never seen before, pause the video and

106
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,219
Google IT. Rewind and watch things many

107
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,860
times if you need to. If you're used to

108
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,710
the pace and breaks of workshops, you'll

109
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,509
find the pace here much faster. The pause

110
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,139
and rewind _______ are your best friends.

111
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,170
Also, in some of the modules of this

112
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,870
course, I'll be presenting you with

113
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,560
challenges, positive video and do these

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,610
challenges. The best way to learn is

115
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,199
really to do. I'll be also asking a lot of

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,089
questions in this course, and I'll answer

117
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,040
these questions right after. But I want

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,350
you to imagine yourself in an interview

119
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,939
for a job about no just-as and treat these

120
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,139
questions as if they were your interview

121
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,000
questions. Try to answer them first before you listen to me answering them.
