00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,660
[Autogenerated] Welcome back. Let's talk

1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,790
about npm nodes. Package Manager npm

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,650
enables JavaScript developers to do three

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,210
main things, share their code with others,

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,309
reuse their own code across projects and

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,500
use code written by others in their

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,190
projects. So npm is basically all about

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,539
code sharing and reusability. If you have

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,879
a piece of JavaScript code that you'd like

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,800
to share with others or just reuse in

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,559
other projects, npm is the tool you need

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,340
to help with that. But npm is also about

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,479
compose ability off bigger applications

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,380
using smaller packages you can use. Others

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,429
work to complete yours so you don't have

15
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,070
to start from complete scratch. In

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,710
general, npm is an asset for any team that

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,109
is working on any job script project. It

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,289
makes it easy to separate and manage the

19
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,359
different versions off good. The npm

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,299
project runs at npm G s dot com. This is

21
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,549
the site that hosts the many useful npm

22
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,200
packages that you're going to love and

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,909
appreciate. It also hosts a lot of empty

24
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:05,890
and useless packages because there is no

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,840
quality control here. Anyone can publish

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,030
anything and we are about to publish

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,060
something in this module. But I'll try to

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,930
make it a bit useful. Npm is the official

29
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,010
note package manager. The npm project

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,390
started with a small set of notes scripts

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,019
to manage common tasks around folders that

32
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,489
contain code for node. And IT sense

33
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,099
evolved into a fully featured package

34
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,799
manager that it's super useful for all job

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,769
script code, not just note. If you browse

36
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,049
the registry of the npm packages that are

37
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,200
hosted on npm JSON dot com, you'll find

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,430
packages that are for node and packages

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,819
that are libraries and frameworks meant to

40
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,579
be used in a browser or a mobile

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,500
application. If you dig deep enough,

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,359
you'll even see examples of APS for

43
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,159
robots, routers and countless other places

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,780
where JavaScript can be executed. A

45
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,510
typical note project will have tens, if

46
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,900
not hundreds of npm packages. Some npm

47
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,719
packages represent big frameworks like

48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,849
express or sales. Some provide utility

49
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,759
functions like load ash here. Some just

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,370
provide useful libraries. The request

51
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,960
package here is an example of that Many

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
npm packages are small and specialized

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,590
around one problem and focused on how to

54
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,379
solve that problem. Well, let's give

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,259
credit where credit is due. Npm simply

56
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,270
revolutionized the way JavaScript

57
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,810
developers work, the life of a JavaScript

58
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,979
developer was much harder before npm. Npm

59
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,110
is a very important part of note, and a

60
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,840
good understanding of how it works will

61
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,580
prove to be very valuable for you as a no

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,039
developer. So what exactly is a package

63
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,310
manager and why do we need IT? Let's

64
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,280
actually start with um, or basic question.

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,500
What is a package? The name package is

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,110
what npm uses toe label. The bits of

67
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,949
reusable good A note package is basically

68
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,479
a folder that contains scripts that can be

69
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,939
run by note, which is to say that any

70
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,159
folder that has some JavaScript code in it

71
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,240
is basically a node package. Another name

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,469
that is commonly used to describe a code

73
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:16,210
folder in note is module. Some modules are

74
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,879
built in note, so npm is not needed to

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,259
manage those but most other modules that

76
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,770
you'll be using our external to note and

77
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,150
npm is what we can use to manage them when

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,560
you have a project that has a lot of these

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,430
good folders that we are going to start

80
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,039
referring to as packages. From now on,

81
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,990
you'll need to manage them somehow,

82
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,009
especially when these packages start

83
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,439
depending on other packages. And when you

84
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,360
start working with multiple versions and

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,669
sources of these packages, that's where

86
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:48,069
npm can be helpful. When developers talk

87
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,740
about npm, they could be talking about one

88
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,509
of many things they could be talking

89
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,789
about. The npm GS website that hosts a

90
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,639
public registry of the many open source

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,740
npm packages. This website provides a few

92
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,930
graphical features, like searching for

93
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,289
packages. For example, every package page

94
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,000
has some meta information about the

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,129
package, like the number of downloads and

96
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,840
other information managed by the package.

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,150
If the package has a read me file, it'll

98
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,360
be displayed here is well. Developers

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,389
could also be talking about the npm

100
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,069
command line interface. The CLI tool that

101
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,300
we can use in our projects to manage the

102
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,449
package is this tool has many commands

103
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,529
that you can see here. We are going to

104
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,339
learn a few of them in this course module.

105
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,839
Npm is also the name of the company npm

106
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,310
Inc that hosts and maintains the npm

107
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,759
Registry and CLI Tool and is doing more

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,060
business around the npm Registry and tool.

109
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,279
They offer private repositories and mawr

110
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,339
enterprise level services. Let's now talk

111
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:51,000
about the npm CLI tool that gives us this global npm command
