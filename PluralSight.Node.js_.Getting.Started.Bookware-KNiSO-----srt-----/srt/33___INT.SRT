[Autogenerated] in this module. We're

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,879
going to talk about two of the core

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,559
fundamentals of note. It's module system

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,650
and how to define and require modules

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,509
using the exports and require objects. And

5
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,669
we'll also talk about how no, IT handles

6
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,629
slow operations and allow the execution of

7
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:19,339
many things at once without using any

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:22,410
threads, which is a big deal. Let's start

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,070
with the simple module system and talk

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,079
about the three important keywords here.

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,000
The module keyword, the exports, keyword and the require keyword.
