[Autogenerated] in this last module, we

1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,490
talked about a few built in note modules.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,469
I went over a few of the capabilities of

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,369
the OS module, the FS module, the child

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:12,689
process module, and I showed you how you

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,320
can debug note applications using Chrome

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,800
Dev tools, which is my favorite feature in

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,750
modern note. It's a wrap on this course. I

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,559
hope you've enjoyed it and learned a thing

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,219
or two. Please don't hesitate to leave me

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,039
any feedback or ask any questions in the

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,719
discussions tab at the course page. If

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,700
this course wasn't helpful to you in any

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,299
way, it'll be nice to hear why and help us

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,530
here at Pluralsight toe Update. Discourse

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,890
for the better. If you're excited about

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,939
node and you're ready to learn more, check

17
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,750
out the advanced Node.js course here at

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,439
Pluralsight. After understanding

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,060
everything in this course, I think you're

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,390
definitely ready for this advanced one.

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,000
And if you like books, I wrote a book as

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,670
well about some of the advanced concepts

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,520
and note if you like smaller reads about

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,689
note, I actively block on medium com, and

25
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,619
a lot of what I write is about note in

26
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,180
JavaScript. Here's one other thing you can

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,370
do. Take that Pluralsight skill. I Q test

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,650
for note and see where your knowledge gaps

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,269
are. Don't get distracted by my awesome

30
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,040
score here. I can't brag about that

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,329
because yours truly wrote the questions

32
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,859
for this skill. I Q test After this

33
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,700
getting started. Course, I'm hoping you'll

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,310
be able to score at least 1 50 on this

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,109
test. And if you take the advanced course

36
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,870
and finish that, you should be able to

37
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,709
score at least 250. If you do take that

38
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,819
score, tweet about it and ping me on

39
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,060
Twitter. Putting these courses together is

40
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,379
long and hard work. It'll be nice to hear

41
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,000
if that effort helped you. Good luck, and thanks for watching.
