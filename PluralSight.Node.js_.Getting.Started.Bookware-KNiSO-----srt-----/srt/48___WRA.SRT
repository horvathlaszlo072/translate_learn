00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,220
[Autogenerated] node was originally

1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,169
designed to help developers create web

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,639
servers, and then it was modified to be a

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,470
more generic runtime for JavaScript. When

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,410
it comes to working with web servers in

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,439
note, you have options. Lots of them.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,280
We've seen how to work with the native

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,030
built in, actually to-be module itself

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,140
that comes with note. We learned how to

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,530
use tools like no _____ to automatically

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,179
reload node in development. We talked

11
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,219
about the request and response objects

12
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,359
within request listeners, and we explored

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,119
the express framework and saw how it

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,369
enables us to write more featured web

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,270
servers using shorter and easier to

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,570
maintain code. We've also looked at an

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,450
example that uses the E. J s TEM plating

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,109
language in the next module will explore

19
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:52,000
three other built in note modules that we can use to work with the operating system.
