00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,950
[Autogenerated] one of the most popular

1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,120
needs when working with web servers is to

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,209
work with a template language to deliver

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,050
static HTML that's generated based on some

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,599
data. Without a template in language, you

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,250
would need to do a lot of shrinking

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,210
combination to accomplish that task. There

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,089
are a few great options when it comes to

8
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,410
template languages with note, and most of

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,559
these options work with the big frameworks

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,410
like KOA and Express. The most popular

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,570
template in language in note is probably

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,969
pug, which used to be named Jade. This is

13
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,479
a simple language implementing the offside

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,890
rule, which means that the STM l nesting

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,869
is based on indentation. I'm not really a

16
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,549
fan of the offside rule, but if it's

17
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,469
something you like, check out pug. My

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,600
favorite template in language and no jazz

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
is handlebars. This is the same language

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,130
that the ember framework uses on. I find

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,719
it to be simple and feature rich, but the

22
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,590
simplest template ing language that you

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,670
can use is probably E. J s for embedded

24
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,390
JavaScript. You get a template language to

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,770
write HTML views, and you can imbed

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,060
JavaScript. While doing so. I prepared an

27
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,340
example for you to see how E. J s can be

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,780
used with the express here under the three

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,260
E. J s folder. Look at the package that

30
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,299
Jason, you'll see that we have the two

31
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,030
dependencies now express and E. J s. And

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,989
to bring these dependencies, you need to

33
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,930
run the npm installed command without any

34
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,849
arguments just like that. Now, look at

35
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,709
Index that Yes, this is the same example

36
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,269
that we've seen without E J s. And here

37
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:34,189
are the differences UI Instruct Express to

38
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,719
set the view engine to E. J s. This is the

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,849
only line really that's needed for

40
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,250
configuring express toe work with E. J s.

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,719
You set the view ancient to-be Js and then

42
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,560
inside of the request listeners instead of

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,450
sand here I am using render Index. This

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,000
means render one of the templates which

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,709
express finds by default under the views

46
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,549
directory inside this folder. So if you

47
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,420
look at the views directory, you'll notice

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,760
that I have an index that e. J s and then

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
about the E. J s and these air to

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,319
templates that are being used to render

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,530
html to the requester when they go to

52
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,939
slash and slash about. So the index that

53
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,870
E. J s has an hello e J s H two element

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,099
and the about the E. J s has an about H

55
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,539
two elements. And if you run the server

56
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,900
and after that, go to the port that we

57
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,539
just used. You'll see the index, the E. J

58
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,930
s template. And if you go to slash about,

59
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,349
you'll see the about E. J s template. And

60
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,250
this is all HTML that's coming from the

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,580
template in language. And because it's all

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,599
embedded JavaScript, you can embed

63
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,710
JavaScript. Let's put a div here and

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,879
inside the deal, I'm going to embed some

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,939
JavaScript. You use this kind of weird

66
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,639
Centex here, and inside of that, you can

67
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,840
put any JavaScript expression. So I'll do

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,199
math dot random, for example, and this

69
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,400
will give me a random value when I refresh

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,270
the template for E. J. S. There you go.

71
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,569
Embedded JavaScript, template ing

72
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,889
language. Very powerful. Now this syntax

73
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,469
here is specific to E. J s. Other

74
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,310
languages will have different syntax for

75
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,860
embedding JavaScript. If you follow my

76
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,900
online courses, you know that I am a big

77
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,469
fan off the react front end library and

78
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,139
the React Library uses the JSX Extension.

79
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,439
So react with JSX can be used as another

80
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,259
template ing option when it comes to

81
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,330
working with note on the back end. And

82
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,680
today, this is actually what I use when I

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,370
need template ing on the server. I use

84
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,770
react itself and GSX on the server, not

85
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,569
just on the front end. If you want to

86
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,780
check out the React y-access library, we

87
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,000
have the react just getting started course on Pluralsight.
