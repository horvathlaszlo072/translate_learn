[Autogenerated] okay, You might be

1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,290
wondering now if it's a normal thing for a

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,379
note process to _____ and exit, and we

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,130
should definitely let it do so. How is

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,839
this going to be an acceptable thing in

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,509
production? Remember when we talked about

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,410
why nodes is named node? Because you don't

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,370
run a single note process in production,

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,859
you run many. One working process exiting

9
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,679
should not mean the system is down. You

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,449
should be running a cluster of note

11
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,780
processes, and that cluster will have a

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,949
master process, which should be monitoring

13
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,280
your application worker processes. This is

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,859
true. Even if you're running a node

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,289
application on a single server, it's often

16
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,950
the case where production servers will

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,380
have many CBU course. You should be

18
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,289
running annoyed. Process for each core if

19
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,140
you're not running cluster. In that case,

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,399
you're not really utilizing the full power

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,179
of your machine. And even if you're

22
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,369
single, production server has a single

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,479
core. You should be running a cluster

24
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,340
anyway, because that cluster has the

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,920
simple job of monitoring the actual note

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,369
process and starting a new one. When the

27
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,700
process crashes and exits, you can run a

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,950
simple cluster in node using the built in

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,340
cluster module on, I go in depth about

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,500
that topic in the advanced Node.js course

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,239
here at Pluralsight. Alternatively, you

32
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,250
can use one of the many tools that wrap

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,079
the cluster module to run your note

34
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,329
application in production. PM two is one

35
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,540
example of these tools. If you run your

36
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,989
note application through a tool like PM to

37
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,549
that tool, can automatically use all the

38
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,629
available course in your server, and it

39
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,590
will automatically create a new process

40
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,989
every time an active process crashes and

41
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,269
exits. PM two can also reload your

42
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,629
application without any downtime. A tool

43
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,000
like PM to is really a must and production.
