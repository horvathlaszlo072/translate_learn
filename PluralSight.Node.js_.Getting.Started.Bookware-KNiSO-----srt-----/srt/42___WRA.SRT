[Autogenerated] This was an important

1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,509
module in this course. We talked about how

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,570
to define a news modules and note, and

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,980
we've seen some examples to define and use

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,400
multiple types off a P I. We talked about

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,820
the special global object and how you

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,370
should avoid using IT. We then talked

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,859
about notes event loop, the hidden magic

8
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,079
that allows you to easily do asynchronous

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,329
programming in node without using any

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,920
threads. UI briefly talked about air

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,929
handling and how to make exceptions for

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,390
problems. We talked about the concept of

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,719
clusters in note and how a master process

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,469
can restart other workers when they have

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,439
problems. We looked at notes, asynchronous

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,759
patterns and saw how the promised pattern

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,759
is a lot more flexible and readable than

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,460
the callback one. And finally we went

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,329
through a simple example for the event

20
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,299
emitter module, which is an important one

21
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,619
because most other modules and note used

22
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,549
the event emitter module one way or

23
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,810
another. In the next module of this

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,380
course, we'll talk about web servers and

25
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,000
how note provides some utilities to program these types of servers
