[Autogenerated] no JSON development is a

1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,370
bit different than many other run times

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,570
and frameworks. IT does not auto reload

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,279
any changes you're going to have to

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,849
remember to restart it. But let me show

5
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:12,009
you a better option. Remember, in this

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,449
same example, when we change things here

7
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,260
and saved UI needed to restart note to see

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,679
the new changes in the browser. This is

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,410
not ideal. The popular solution to this

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,219
problem in note is to monitor the

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,480
operating system files for saving events

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,589
and try to add a restart note. When you

13
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,750
get these events. There are many npm

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,060
packages that are designed for this exact

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,039
purpose. I usually use no _____. You just

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,420
npm install dash G node mon. It's probably

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,700
a good idea to have this package installed

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,740
globally, but it doesn't really have to

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,810
be. Once you have access to the note mon

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,909
command, you run your code with note mon

21
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,729
instead of note. So no _____ one. Hello

22
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:59,280
world Duchess, The note mon command is a

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,479
wrapper around the note command. So the

24
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,729
note mon command we just typed will run

25
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,019
our server as if we're running it with the

26
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,799
node command. But now it will monitor the

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,859
files for any save events and reload

28
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,349
itself when files are saved. So when we

29
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,859
change this to note and just hit the save

30
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,799
button, no _____ automatically restarted

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,599
itself and you'll be able to see the new

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,150
changes in effect. Of course, you don't

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,000
need this node mont package in production. This is just a development convenience.
