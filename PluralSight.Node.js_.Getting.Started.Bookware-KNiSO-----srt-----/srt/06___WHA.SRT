[Autogenerated] follow this video for

1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,290
instructions on how to install. Note. If

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,009
you've successfully installed note, you

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,630
should see the following three commands

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,589
available globally in your system. First,

5
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,640
the note command itself, which, if you run

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,260
it without any argument, you'll get into

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,089
this interactive program where you can

8
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,530
type and execute JavaScript. Here's a

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,920
quick test of how modern your notice. I

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,429
typed the test for you right here under

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,339
this GitHub. Just go find this code and

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,840
then copy this line here the first line

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,490
and paste it into the nodes. Interactive

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,359
session. Don't worry. If you don't

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,700
understand this, it's just a test of your

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,820
note capabilities. If this line was

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,250
executed successfully without any errors

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,560
like it did for me here you have a good

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,340
version of note. If you get an error here,

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,869
you should upgrade your note for this

21
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,590
course. This course has a modern

22
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,450
JavaScript module where I'm going to

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,570
explain the modern concept this simple

24
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,420
line is using. You can also test if your

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,540
note has the new promises. AP Ice. Using

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,359
these two calls in here, you tell that

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,260
promise. If I should return a function

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,420
like this and require F s dot promises

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,030
should return an object of the full F s, a

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,569
p I just like this. Also, if you want to

31
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,909
use Eckman script modules with node, the

32
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,230
import statement should be available. And

33
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,019
it should give this exact specific error

34
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,159
in the rebel here because we can't use it

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,950
in a rebel, but it's available for

36
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,439
modules. So if these calls are giving you

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,060
errors or undefined objects, it will be a

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,859
good idea for you to upgrade your note

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,090
before starting this course. The other two

40
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,750
global commands that you should have our

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,959
npm and MPX. You get these as well. When

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,030
you install node, we'll talk about these

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,859
commands in the course module dedicated

44
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,599
for npm. If you see these commands working

45
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,829
successfully for you, you can skip the

46
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,629
rest of this installation instructions

47
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:57,060
video to install node on windows. You can

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,450
simply download the installer from the No,

49
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,170
just the order website and granite

50
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,189
Locally. This way you'll be installing

51
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,379
note natively on the Windows operating

52
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,530
system. But remember what I said about

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,310
node on windows in the overview video

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,719
note. Natively on Windows is not really

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,270
ideal, but if it's your only option don't

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,039
let that stop you. If you were able to get

57
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,400
a Linux subsystem working for you on

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,650
Windows great. All you need is to

59
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,360
commands. Let me show you how to find them

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,830
here real quick in this downloads page

61
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,990
scroll and find the article about

62
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,819
installing note via a package manager.

63
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,629
Click that you can also just Google this

64
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,310
exact title here. If the U I of the note

65
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,050
website has changed, the Linux

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,689
distribution that you used in your

67
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,210
subsystem is probably open to hear. So

68
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,860
click on that link and under the section

69
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,360
here, you'll find lines to install the

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,150
recent version of note. So these are the

71
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,879
two lines that you need in your subsystem

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,360
or Linux in general. You should also

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,530
invoke this other line here about build

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,930
essentials just in case you need to

75
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,939
install any Native Addams in the future.

76
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:06,090
On Mac, you can download and install no

77
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,550
directly. But if you're already using the

78
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,219
excellent Homebrew package manager, you

79
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,139
can just use that All you need is brew

80
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,949
install note, and this will give you the

81
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,050
latest note. If you don't have homebrew on

82
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,840
your Mac, you should really take a look at

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,430
it. It's pretty cool. If you have an older

84
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,520
version of note running through homebrew,

85
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,699
the command you need here is brew upgrade

86
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,810
Note. Just like that, there is another

87
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,370
option that works on both Mac and Linux,

88
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,009
and that is envy M node version manager. I

89
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,599
like this option because it allows you to

90
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,159
run multiple versions of note and switch

91
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,919
between them using a simple command. If

92
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,789
you find yourself in a situation where you

93
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,889
need to work on a project that use

94
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,449
different versions of node, N. V. M will

95
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,550
help you here. That's it for installing

96
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,389
note. Don't forget to make sure these

97
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:49,000
lines work for you on your new note you just installed.
