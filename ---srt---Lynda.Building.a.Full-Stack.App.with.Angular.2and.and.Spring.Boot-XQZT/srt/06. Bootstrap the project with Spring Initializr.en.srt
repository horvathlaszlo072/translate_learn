1
00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:02.05
- [Instructor] Now let's
create our Spring Boot project

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.02
using Spring Initializer.

3
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:09.06
We will navigate to start.spring.io.

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:15.03
Select Gradle Project with
the latest stable release.

5
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:18.02
Gradle is a build and
dependency management tool

6
00:00:18.02 --> 00:00:19.06
similar to Maven.

7
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:23.05
Gradle uses a Groovy DSL instead of XML.

8
00:00:23.05 --> 00:00:26.01
This makes Gradle files less verbose,

9
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.07
more readable, and more scriptable.

10
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:29.08
For the Group field,

11
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:33.00
enter in communication.linkedin.learning.

12
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:36.04
Note that the names and
folder structure I chose

13
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:37.09
are arbitrary.

14
00:00:37.09 --> 00:00:41.00
You can choose your own
names and folder structure,

15
00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:44.09
and this will not impact the
functionality of the project.

16
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:46.07
For the artifact name, enter in

17
00:00:46.07 --> 00:00:59.01
linked-in-learning-full-stack-app-angular-spring-boot.

18
00:00:59.01 --> 00:01:02.04
This artifact name will
define the name of the

19
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:05.01
self executable JAR.

20
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:09.05
Next you want to click on
Switch to the full version.

21
00:01:09.05 --> 00:01:13.06
For their description, enter
in Building a Full-stack App

22
00:01:13.06 --> 00:01:17.01
with AngularJS 2 and Spring Boot.

23
00:01:17.01 --> 00:01:20.02
Next we will add the
following dependencies.

24
00:01:20.02 --> 00:01:23.05
Web, JPA, and H2.

25
00:01:23.05 --> 00:01:25.06
Web will allow us to define our end points

26
00:01:25.06 --> 00:01:28.06
using a annotation-based system.

27
00:01:28.06 --> 00:01:33.01
JPA will allow us to implement
JPA-based repositories

28
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:36.01
to interact with the data.

29
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:39.08
H2 is a really fast embedded database

30
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:44.00
that will start up when
you start your application.

31
00:01:44.00 --> 00:01:46.06
Next let's click Generate Project.

32
00:01:46.06 --> 00:01:48.07
This will generate a Zip file that will

33
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:50.05
automatically be downloaded.

34
00:01:50.05 --> 00:01:54.08
Extract the Zip folder into
your projects directory.

35
00:01:54.08 --> 00:01:57.03
Let's grab the file we just downloaded.

36
00:01:57.03 --> 00:02:02.00
Let's copy the file, navigate
to our home directory,

37
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:09.02
create a new folder, rename
it to EclipseProjects.

38
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:13.00
Let's go into that directory
and paste in our Zip file

39
00:02:13.00 --> 00:02:14.07
and then extract it.
