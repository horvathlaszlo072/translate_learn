00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:30.08
let's make sure it is up to date.

13
00:00:30.08 --> 00:00:34.01

00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:38.01
by running Brew Doctor.

15
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:41.00
Okay it looks like we have
Brew installed correctly.

16
00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:43.01
Now, let's add it to the path.

17
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:52.02
Type in export path /usr/local/bin path.

18
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:54.05
Okay now that we have brew set up

19
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:57.05
let's install node JS using Brew.

20
00:00:57.05 --> 00:01:01.09
Type in brew install node.

21
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:04.07
Okay so now we have node installed.

22
00:01:04.07 --> 00:01:07.05
Next let's install get

00:01:07.05 --> 00:01:10.03
and then finally let's install Gradle.

24
00:01:10.03 --> 00:01:13.00
