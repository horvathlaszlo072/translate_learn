00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.07
- [Instructor] Okay, we have
built a fully functional

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.00
full stack application together.

3
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:08.00
To learn more on your own,
you can implement the PUT

4
00:00:08.00 --> 00:00:10.01
and DELETE endpoints.

5
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:13.00
You can also experiment
with client and server side

6
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:16.07
filtering in our GET
available rooms endpoint.

7
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:20.06
For example, you could filter
on fields such as price.

8
00:00:20.06 --> 00:00:23.05
In this course, we only
touched on unit testing.

9
00:00:23.05 --> 00:00:25.09
However, it is very important.

10
00:00:25.09 --> 00:00:29.08
You want to have automated
testing in place for all major

11
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:31.05
functionality.

12
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:34.05
You want to be sure to test
your Java code as well as

13
00:00:34.05 --> 00:00:37.00
your AngularJS 2 code.

14
00:00:37.00 --> 00:00:40.06
Back-end testing frameworks
we used include JUnit

15
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:42.04
and Rest Assured.

16
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:46.04
Testing frameworks on the
front-end provided by AngularJS 2

17
00:00:46.04 --> 00:00:49.09
are Karma, Jasmine and Selenium.

18
00:00:49.09 --> 00:00:52.04
You have many types of testing.

19
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:55.00
The most basic type is unit testing.

20
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:59.02
Examples of unit testing
frameworks are JUnit, Karma

21
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:00.08
and Jasmine.

22
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:03.04
Examples of integration testing frameworks

23
00:01:03.04 --> 00:01:05.07
are the spring test runner.

24
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:09.07
An example of a end-to-end
testing framework is Selenium.

25
00:01:09.07 --> 00:01:12.07
There are lots of great
courses on testing here

26
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:15.03
on LinkedIn Learning,
so go check them out.

27
00:01:15.03 --> 00:01:18.07
As we have learned, Spring
Boot and AngularJS 2

28
00:01:18.07 --> 00:01:21.06
are powerful and flexible tools.

29
00:01:21.06 --> 00:01:25.01
So I recommend you get out
there and build something.
