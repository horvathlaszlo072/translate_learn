00:00:00.01 --> 00:00:02.06
- [Instructor] Okay, now
that we've a working REST API

2
00:00:02.06 --> 00:00:06.00
on the back end, let's start
working on the front end.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:08.08
Let's open up a terminal,
and do a global install

4
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:13.06
of the AngularJS 2 command
line interface or CLI,

5
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:18.08
using the Node Package Manager or NPM.

6
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:22.07
Next, let's set up the front
end, using the Angular CLI.

7
00:00:22.07 --> 00:00:25.05
Let's go ahead and navigate
to our project directory.

8
00:00:25.05 --> 00:00:29.03
CD into source, CD into main.

9
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:33.01
Then, let's create a new
directory called Webapp.

10
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:35.06
Next up, we will generate
the base project,

11
00:00:35.06 --> 00:00:39.04
using the Angular CLI command ng new.

12
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:42.02
Ng new will generate a project scaffold,

13
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:46.00
with everything you
need to run AngularJS 2.

14
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:49.02
By default, ng new will
initialize your project

15
00:00:49.02 --> 00:00:51.08
as a Git Repository.

16
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:55.08
Since we want our Java
Spring re: project directory

17
00:00:55.08 --> 00:01:01.01
to be a Git Repo, instead of
the AngularJS 2 project route,

18
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:04.06
we will be passing in the flag skip-git.

19
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:07.06
Let's CD into the Webapp directory.

20
00:01:07.06 --> 00:01:11.02
Next, let's run the ng new command,

21
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:16.03
passing in the name Angular2,
and the flag skip-git.

22
00:01:16.03 --> 00:01:19.08
Okay, now that we created
the Angular2 application,

23
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:23.01
let's CD into the folder we just created.

24
00:01:23.01 --> 00:01:27.01
Next, let's install Twitter
Bootstrap three, using NPM.

25
00:01:27.01 --> 00:01:30.03
Twitter Bootstap is a grid
based UI component framework.

26
00:01:30.03 --> 00:01:31.07
It will provide us with some good looking,

27
00:01:31.07 --> 00:01:34.07
out of the box, UI components to use.

28
00:01:34.07 --> 00:01:37.00
Don't worry, prior
knowledge of this framework,

29
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.06
is not necessary, since we are just using

30
00:01:39.06 --> 00:01:43.00
the basic pre-build components.

31
00:01:43.00 --> 00:01:45.06
Finally, let's install Fuel UX.

32
00:01:45.06 --> 00:01:48.00
Fuel UX extends Twitter Bootstrap,

33
00:01:48.00 --> 00:01:51.08
and adds some additional UI
components such as a datepicker.

34
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:53.09
Okay, now that we're all set up,

35
00:01:53.09 --> 00:01:55.06
let's insure it starts up correctly,

36
00:01:55.06 --> 00:01:59.04
using the Angular CLI command ng serve.

37
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:02.01
By default, ng serve will run the app

38
00:02:02.01 --> 00:02:05.04
on local host on port 4200.

39
00:02:05.04 --> 00:02:07.01
Okay, now that we're started up,

40
00:02:07.01 --> 00:02:10.03
let's try to hit that
endpoint in a browser.

41
00:02:10.03 --> 00:02:14.00
If you see that message, it
means your app is running.

42
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:17.03
Next up, let's work on customizing our UI.
