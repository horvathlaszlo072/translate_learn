00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.07
- [Narrator] Alright,
let's add the functionality

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.05
to your reserve a room from our front end.

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:09.08
Let's open up app.component.ts.

4
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:12.01
We added getAll previously,

5
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:15.08
but executed a get request to our API.

6
00:00:15.08 --> 00:00:18.03
Now, we want to execute a post.

7
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:22.00
First, let's create two
fields to keep track of

8
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:26.00
the values check in ad
check out from the form.

9
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:27.09
Let's name it current check in value

10
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:31.04
and current check out value.

11
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:35.07
Next in ngOnInit, let's
subscribe to changes

12
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:37.07
from our form group.

13
00:00:37.07 --> 00:00:42.03
Let's define a field called
roomsearchValueChanges.

14
00:00:42.03 --> 00:00:46.09
First, let's define a constant,
roomsearchValueChanges,

15
00:00:46.09 --> 00:00:52.07
and let's set that equal to roomsearch,

16
00:00:52.07 --> 00:00:55.08
which is our form group,

17
00:00:55.08 --> 00:00:58.09
and we're going to set it to valueChanges.

18
00:00:58.09 --> 00:01:00.06
Now that we have that set,

19
00:01:00.06 --> 00:01:05.01
we can subscribe to these
value change events.

20
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:07.09
Let's pass in a lamda.

21
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:12.08
Let's copy currentCheckInVal
and set it equal

22
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:16.04
to the value in that form field.

23
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:22.06
Same thing on currentCheckOutValue.

24
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:26.05
That was any time we omit
a value change event,

25
00:01:26.05 --> 00:01:31.01
we are capturing the current
value in these two strings.

26
00:01:31.01 --> 00:01:34.06
Next, let's create a
function called reserve room.

27
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:38.06
We'll take in a parameter
called value on the type string.

28
00:01:38.06 --> 00:01:41.08
Let's create a new request body object.

29
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:46.05
Let's name it ReserveRoomRequest.

30
00:01:46.05 --> 00:01:50.03
Let's add a roomId string, checkin string,

31
00:01:50.03 --> 00:01:53.02
and a checkout string.

32
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:57.03
Then, let's create a constructor,

33
00:01:57.03 --> 00:02:01.04
and then let's copy these three fields,

34
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:06.01
and paste them into the
constructor parameters.

35
00:02:06.01 --> 00:02:08.04
Let's take off the semi-colons,

36
00:02:08.04 --> 00:02:12.01
and delimit each parameter with a comma.

37
00:02:12.01 --> 00:02:14.05
Then, within the body of the constructor,

38
00:02:14.05 --> 00:02:20.04
let's set all the fields.

39
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:23.04
Then shift F to format,

40
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:28.03
then let's head back to
the reserveroom function.

41
00:02:28.03 --> 00:02:32.00
It actually looks like we
had reserveroom defined,

42
00:02:32.00 --> 00:02:34.08
so let's use that existing function.

43
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:43.00
Let's create a request body,
passing in the parameter value,

44
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:46.03
which will be the room ID
that you want to reserve,

45
00:02:46.03 --> 00:02:51.03
the current value in the
field currentCheckInValue,

46
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:54.02
which is populated from the form element,

47
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:57.04
and the currectCheckOutValue.

48
00:02:57.04 --> 00:03:01.01
Next, let's create a
createReservation function.

49
00:03:01.01 --> 00:03:03.01
Let's pass in that request body,

50
00:03:03.01 --> 00:03:12.06
let's copy ReserveRoomRequest class name.

51
00:03:12.06 --> 00:03:16.00
Let's serialize that
ReserveRoomRequest object

52
00:03:16.00 --> 00:03:19.04
into a JSON string.

53
00:03:19.04 --> 00:03:24.02
Let's add some headers and
let's create an array in place

54
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:25.07
and pass in the

55
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:31.08
single header Content-Type
equals to application JSON.

56
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:34.09
Then let's set the request options.

57
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:42.00
Fix the typo in content type,
and let's add these headers.

58
00:03:42.00 --> 00:03:47.00
Let's use the HTTP
module to execute a post

59
00:03:47.00 --> 00:03:54.01
passing in the base URL and
the domain and resource,

60
00:03:54.01 --> 00:03:58.03
the request body, and headers.

61
00:03:58.03 --> 00:04:02.07
Then let's subscribe to the
observable that gets returned.

62
00:04:02.07 --> 00:04:06.09
Let's pass in a lamda, and at this point,

63
00:04:06.09 --> 00:04:12.09
all we're going to do is log
that response to the console.

64
00:04:12.09 --> 00:04:17.00
Let's save and webpack
compiled our changes,

65
00:04:17.00 --> 00:04:19.08
so let's head back to our application.

66
00:04:19.08 --> 00:04:22.05
Let's do a refresh.

67
00:04:22.05 --> 00:04:25.00
Let's search for available rooms,

68
00:04:25.00 --> 00:04:27.06
let's right click and inspect,

69
00:04:27.06 --> 00:04:29.01
and then open up the console.

70
00:04:29.01 --> 00:04:34.00
When you click reserve, we
can see that we made a request

71
00:04:34.00 --> 00:04:38.08
to our API and got back a successful 201.

72
00:04:38.08 --> 00:04:40.07
Let's check on our API,

73
00:04:40.07 --> 00:04:47.05
and let's look at that room
with ID one and room number 405.

74
00:04:47.05 --> 00:04:49.08
Now, it looks like we
have two reservations

75
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:51.09
attached to that room.

76
00:04:51.09 --> 00:04:54.00
So it looks like we were successfully able

77
00:04:54.00 --> 00:04:57.05
to reserve a room from our front end UI

78
00:04:57.05 --> 00:05:01.08
using AngularJS2, and the HTTP module.

79
00:05:01.08 --> 00:05:03.02
Now that we are tracking

80
00:05:03.02 --> 00:05:07.03
the current value of the CheckIn field,

81
00:05:07.03 --> 00:05:11.03
let's go ahead an update the get URL

82
00:05:11.03 --> 00:05:14.03
so that we're passing in the actual value

83
00:05:14.03 --> 00:05:23.08
of that form field instead
of the hard-coded value.

84
00:05:23.08 --> 00:05:26.03
Let's save our changes, let's refresh,

85
00:05:26.03 --> 00:05:31.05
and let's make sure our get still works.

86
00:05:31.05 --> 00:05:34.03
We are now passing in
the CheckIn and CheckOut

87
00:05:34.03 --> 00:05:36.06
from the form fields dynamically.
