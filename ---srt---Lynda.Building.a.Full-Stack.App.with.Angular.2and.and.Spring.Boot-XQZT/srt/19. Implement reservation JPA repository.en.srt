1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:02.05
- [Narrator] Next up let's implement

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.05
the reservation JPA repository.

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:10.00
Reservations will be another
table in our database.

4
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:12.02
There will be a one to many relationship

5
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:14.09
between room and reservation.

6
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:19.02
One room can potentially have
many different reservations.

7
00:00:19.02 --> 00:00:23.05
First off, let's rename
reservation response

8
00:00:23.05 --> 00:00:27.02
to reservable room response.

9
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:30.06
This will more accurately
reflect the purpose.

10
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:33.07
Let's right click on reservation response,

11
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:41.03
go to refactor, rename.

12
00:00:41.03 --> 00:00:46.02
Make sure update references
is checked, and click finish.

13
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:49.03
Let's also take a look at the room entity

14
00:00:49.03 --> 00:00:53.01
to reservation response converter.

15
00:00:53.01 --> 00:00:55.03
We can see the type was updated,

16
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:59.08
but not the base class name.

17
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:02.02
So let's right click on the name,

18
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:08.08
go to refactor, and rename.

19
00:01:08.08 --> 00:01:13.06
Okay, let's double check
in our conversion config,

20
00:01:13.06 --> 00:01:17.04
and we can see the name
was properly updated.

21
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:21.00
Next up, let's add a reservation entity

22
00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:24.07
to model the reservation table.

23
00:01:24.07 --> 00:01:31.01
Let's create a new class in
entity called reservation entity

24
00:01:31.01 --> 00:01:33.05
and click finish.

25
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:37.09
Okay, first up let's
add a entity annotation.

26
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:39.09
Be sure to import the entity

27
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:44.08
annotation from Java X persistence.

28
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:50.01
Next up, add a table annotation,
and then let's import it.

29
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:54.07
Let's pass in the table name
to that table annotation.

30
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:59.09
Let's set the name equal to reservation.

31
00:01:59.09 --> 00:02:03.09
First let's add a ID of the type long.

32
00:02:03.09 --> 00:02:06.01
Let's add the annotation ID.

33
00:02:06.01 --> 00:02:07.03
Let's import it.

34
00:02:07.03 --> 00:02:10.00
Then let's make sure this ID gets

35
00:02:10.00 --> 00:02:13.07
automatically generated upon creation.

36
00:02:13.07 --> 00:02:16.04
Let's add that generated value annotation,

37
00:02:16.04 --> 00:02:19.02
make sure it gets imported,
and then let's pass

38
00:02:19.02 --> 00:02:23.07
in the field strategy
equals generation type auto.

39
00:02:23.07 --> 00:02:26.00
Next up let's add a private

40
00:02:26.00 --> 00:02:28.05
local date field called check in.

41
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:31.06
Let's add a not null
annotation to make sure

42
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:34.03
it gets populated upon creation.

43
00:02:34.03 --> 00:02:38.04
Let's import that local date class.

44
00:02:38.04 --> 00:02:41.09
Let's create another field
local date check out.

45
00:02:41.09 --> 00:02:44.02
Now let's be sure to add that

46
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:48.09
not null annotation, all right?

47
00:02:48.09 --> 00:02:52.07
As a reminder, the keyboard
shortcut to generate getters

48
00:02:52.07 --> 00:02:57.03
and setters is command alt S.

49
00:02:57.03 --> 00:02:59.07
Go to generate getters and setters

50
00:02:59.07 --> 00:03:03.05
and click on select all then OK.

51
00:03:03.05 --> 00:03:06.08
Let's add our constructors.

52
00:03:06.08 --> 00:03:09.09
First one takes in check in and check out.

53
00:03:09.09 --> 00:03:13.06
Next one is parameter
list, deselect all, and OK.

54
00:03:13.06 --> 00:03:19.06
Then command shift F to
autoformat and then save.

55
00:03:19.06 --> 00:03:23.04
Now let's open up the room entity.

56
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:26.03
Let's add a list of reservations entities

57
00:03:26.03 --> 00:03:29.08
called reservation entity list.

58
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:33.06
Command shift O, view our
imports, then let's add

59
00:03:33.06 --> 00:03:36.04
an annotation one to many.

60
00:03:36.04 --> 00:03:39.07
Command shift O, this
one to many annotation

61
00:03:39.07 --> 00:03:41.09
indicates that there is a relationship

62
00:03:41.09 --> 00:03:46.03
between room entity
and reservation entity.

63
00:03:46.03 --> 00:03:49.01
A room may have multiple reservations.

64
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:53.07
That's why this room has a list.

65
00:03:53.07 --> 00:03:56.08
Let's add fetch type set to eager,

66
00:03:56.08 --> 00:04:02.09
and let's say cascade to persist.

67
00:04:02.09 --> 00:04:06.00
Then when we save this
entity, any reservation entity

68
00:04:06.00 --> 00:04:09.00
children connected to this room entity

69
00:04:09.00 --> 00:04:14.04
will also be persisted.

70
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:16.07
Then let's add a getter and setter

71
00:04:16.07 --> 00:04:19.05
for the field we just added.

72
00:04:19.05 --> 00:04:23.06
Command alt S, generate,
select reservation entity list,

73
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:25.06
and OK.

74
00:04:25.06 --> 00:04:33.06
Let's also add a method
called add reservation entity.

75
00:04:33.06 --> 00:04:36.09
If reservation entity
list is currently null,

76
00:04:36.09 --> 00:04:39.06
let's create a new one.

77
00:04:39.06 --> 00:04:47.09
Control space to autopopulate.

78
00:04:47.09 --> 00:04:52.07
And let's set it to a
new array list if null.

79
00:04:52.07 --> 00:04:56.07
Control shift O to import, then let's add

80
00:04:56.07 --> 00:05:00.04
the new reservation entity to the list.

81
00:05:00.04 --> 00:05:06.04
Control space, add and
then let's make sure

82
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:09.04
we're operating on the list, all right?

83
00:05:09.04 --> 00:05:11.01
And then save.

84
00:05:11.01 --> 00:05:15.05
Next, let's open up reservation request.

85
00:05:15.05 --> 00:05:19.03
Let's add in a field private long room ID.

86
00:05:19.03 --> 00:05:22.00
Room ID is the ID of the room that

87
00:05:22.00 --> 00:05:25.03
you want to attach your reservation to.

88
00:05:25.03 --> 00:05:30.01
Let's delete the
constructor, control alt S,

89
00:05:30.01 --> 00:05:39.05
and create a new one with
every field except ID.

90
00:05:39.05 --> 00:05:45.02
Then let's add a getter and
setter for that room ID field.

91
00:05:45.02 --> 00:05:52.02
Control shift F to
reformat, and then save.

92
00:05:52.02 --> 00:05:55.02
Let's create a new class in response.

93
00:05:55.02 --> 00:05:58.07
New class, and let's name it

94
00:05:58.07 --> 00:06:02.06
reservation response, and finish.

95
00:06:02.06 --> 00:06:03.07
Okay?

96
00:06:03.07 --> 00:06:07.03
Let's add in two fields,
check in and check out,

97
00:06:07.03 --> 00:06:09.04
of the type local date.

98
00:06:09.04 --> 00:06:12.01
Command shift O to import,
and let's not forget

99
00:06:12.01 --> 00:06:19.05
the ID field as well, of
the type long, all right?

100
00:06:19.05 --> 00:06:23.04
Let's throw in the getters and setters,

101
00:06:23.04 --> 00:06:29.00
and then add in the fronter.

102
00:06:29.00 --> 00:06:31.08
And then one more.

103
00:06:31.08 --> 00:06:38.02
Deselect all, command
shift F, format, and save.

104
00:06:38.02 --> 00:06:42.04
Next up, let's add a JPA repository.

105
00:06:42.04 --> 00:06:46.05
Right click on repository, new, class.

106
00:06:46.05 --> 00:06:51.06
Let's name it reservation
repository, and create.

107
00:06:51.06 --> 00:06:56.06
All right, let's make sure it
extends the crud repository.

108
00:06:56.06 --> 00:07:00.07
It'll take in a reservation
entity and a long.

109
00:07:00.07 --> 00:07:06.07
Command shift O, let's make
sure this is a interface.

110
00:07:06.07 --> 00:07:09.07
Command shift O, and save.

111
00:07:09.07 --> 00:07:13.02
All right, let's create some converters.

112
00:07:13.02 --> 00:07:17.05
Right click on converter,
new, class, all right?

113
00:07:17.05 --> 00:07:20.01
This one will be reservation request

114
00:07:20.01 --> 00:07:23.01
to reservation entity converter.

115
00:07:23.01 --> 00:07:27.05
This class will take in a
request body from a rest API

116
00:07:27.05 --> 00:07:31.00
call and convert it to
a reservation entity

117
00:07:31.00 --> 00:07:33.01
so that we can save it.

118
00:07:33.01 --> 00:07:36.04
Let's implement the converter,
passing in a reservation

119
00:07:36.04 --> 00:07:39.06
request and a reservation entity.

120
00:07:39.06 --> 00:07:42.06
Fix that typo.

121
00:07:42.06 --> 00:07:46.01
Command shift O to import
and let's make sure

122
00:07:46.01 --> 00:07:49.09
we grab the spring framework converter.

123
00:07:49.09 --> 00:07:53.04
If you click on this error
and click on add unimplemented

124
00:07:53.04 --> 00:07:56.05
methods, it will stub out the method

125
00:07:56.05 --> 00:07:59.05
that you have to override, all right?

126
00:07:59.05 --> 00:08:06.02
Let's create a reservation entity.

127
00:08:06.02 --> 00:08:09.05
Make sure that gets returned.

128
00:08:09.05 --> 00:08:14.04
Let's set the check in
to the source check in.

129
00:08:14.04 --> 00:08:19.03
Let's set the check out
to the source check out,

130
00:08:19.03 --> 00:08:23.01
and then if the source ID is not null,

131
00:08:23.01 --> 00:08:26.01
let's also set that.

132
00:08:26.01 --> 00:08:29.02
Control space to autopopulate, dot set ID.

133
00:08:29.02 --> 00:08:35.04
Command shift F to format, and save.

134
00:08:35.04 --> 00:08:38.00
Let's create one more converter.

135
00:08:38.00 --> 00:08:40.09
This one going from a reservation

136
00:08:40.09 --> 00:08:43.09
entity to a reservation response.

137
00:08:43.09 --> 00:08:47.09
Make sure it's an interface.

138
00:08:47.09 --> 00:08:50.02
Let's make sure it implements converter

139
00:08:50.02 --> 00:08:56.03
going from reservation entity
to reservation response.

140
00:08:56.03 --> 00:09:00.06
Let's make sure that's class, actually.

141
00:09:00.06 --> 00:09:04.07
Okay, let's import converter,
command shift O to do

142
00:09:04.07 --> 00:09:09.08
our imports, click on the error,
add unimplemented methods.

143
00:09:09.08 --> 00:09:15.04
Create a reservation response.

144
00:09:15.04 --> 00:09:19.00
Make sure that gets returned.

145
00:09:19.00 --> 00:09:24.00
Set the check in and set the check out.

146
00:09:24.00 --> 00:09:26.07
Okay, and save.

147
00:09:26.07 --> 00:09:29.04
Next, let's open up conversion config

148
00:09:29.04 --> 00:09:41.04
and add those two converters.

149
00:09:41.04 --> 00:09:44.07
Let's make sure this is named correctly.

150
00:09:44.07 --> 00:09:48.00
Let's right click, refactor and rename,

151
00:09:48.00 --> 00:09:53.03
and let's append converter
to that name, and save.

152
00:09:53.03 --> 00:09:57.08
Let's open up the reservation
resource, all right?

153
00:09:57.08 --> 00:09:58.09
It's in rest.

154
00:09:58.09 --> 00:10:05.04
First, let's add the
reservation repository.

155
00:10:05.04 --> 00:10:10.02
Get it autowired, head
back to the post end point,

156
00:10:10.02 --> 00:10:14.00
then let's convert the reservation request

157
00:10:14.00 --> 00:10:18.05
into a reservation entity.

158
00:10:18.05 --> 00:10:25.01
Let's autowire the conversion service.

159
00:10:25.01 --> 00:10:29.03
Okay, now we have access to that beam.

160
00:10:29.03 --> 00:10:34.00
Let's pass in the reservation request

161
00:10:34.00 --> 00:10:36.05
and set the expected target type

162
00:10:36.05 --> 00:10:41.01
to reservation entity dot class.

163
00:10:41.01 --> 00:10:44.02
Let's grab the reservation
repository beam,

164
00:10:44.02 --> 00:10:48.04
and then save that entity.

165
00:10:48.04 --> 00:10:51.00
Let's grab the room repository beam.

166
00:10:51.00 --> 00:10:52.09
Let's call a find by ID

167
00:10:52.09 --> 00:10:58.08
and get the room ID from
the reservation request.

168
00:10:58.08 --> 00:11:04.05
Let's grab the response.

169
00:11:04.05 --> 00:11:08.03
Then in that room entity
let's add reservation entity

170
00:11:08.03 --> 00:11:12.05
to the list of linked reservations.

171
00:11:12.05 --> 00:11:18.00
Then using room repository,
let's save that room entity.

172
00:11:18.00 --> 00:11:24.02
We are also going to persist
the linked reservation entity.

173
00:11:24.02 --> 00:11:28.05
Let's actually head back
to the reservation entity

174
00:11:28.05 --> 00:11:31.09
and add a room entity field,

175
00:11:31.09 --> 00:11:37.02
and let's add a many to one annotation,

176
00:11:37.02 --> 00:11:41.06
since we could have many
reservations for one room.

177
00:11:41.06 --> 00:11:47.07
Let's save and add a getter and setter.

178
00:11:47.07 --> 00:11:50.07
Select room entity and OK.

179
00:11:50.07 --> 00:11:57.01
Command shift F to format and save.

180
00:11:57.01 --> 00:12:00.09
Let's set the room entity
to return in the response,

181
00:12:00.09 --> 00:12:05.05
then let's create the
reservation response.

182
00:12:05.05 --> 00:12:12.02
Use the conversion service,
passing in a reservation entity

183
00:12:12.02 --> 00:12:16.07
and expecting a reservation response back.

184
00:12:16.07 --> 00:12:21.01
All right, let's grab
that reservation response,

185
00:12:21.01 --> 00:12:25.09
and make sure that gets
returned in the response entity.

186
00:12:25.09 --> 00:12:32.05
Let's make sure we have
the correct return type,

187
00:12:32.05 --> 00:12:33.09
and then save.

188
00:12:33.09 --> 00:12:37.03
Let's restart.

189
00:12:37.03 --> 00:12:40.09
And let's test our post.

190
00:12:40.09 --> 00:12:46.07
Getting a 404, 'cause I might
be expecting an ID field.

191
00:12:46.07 --> 00:12:50.03
Let's close.

192
00:12:50.03 --> 00:12:55.03
Let's reopen the post.

193
00:12:55.03 --> 00:12:58.01
Okay, after we open up a fresh query,

194
00:12:58.01 --> 00:13:05.01
we submitted the post, and we
got a 201 created in response.

195
00:13:05.01 --> 00:13:06.09
Let's do a get.

196
00:13:06.09 --> 00:13:11.00
Let's click on the self referential link.

197
00:13:11.00 --> 00:13:13.05
We could see that reservation entity

198
00:13:13.05 --> 00:13:18.00
has been linked to the
room with the ID of one.

199
00:13:18.00 --> 00:13:21.02
So we could see that
the reservation entity

200
00:13:21.02 --> 00:13:24.09
was properly cascaded and
linked to this room entity

201
00:13:24.09 --> 00:13:28.05
when save was executed on room repository.
