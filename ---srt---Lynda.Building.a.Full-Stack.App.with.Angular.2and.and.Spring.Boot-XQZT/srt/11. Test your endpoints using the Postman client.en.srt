00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:04.00
an application called Postman.

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:07.00
Postman is a GUI tool
to make API development

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:08.05
faster and easier.

5
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.07
It can help you test, document,

6
00:00:10.07 --> 00:00:12.09
and share your API endpoints.

7
00:00:12.09 --> 00:00:17.07
In a browser, let's
navigate to getpostman.com

8
00:00:17.07 --> 00:00:19.07

00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:23.04

Let's navigate to the Downloaded file,

11
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:28.02

00:00:28.02 --> 00:00:32.01
and let's Add it to our
Applications Directory.

13
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:35.02
Then, let's Double click
on the Application.

14
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:37.04
The first time you install Postman,

15
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:40.06
you may be prompted to create an account.

16
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:42.01
On the left-hand side,

17
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:44.07
you will see a section called collections.

18
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:47.01
Let's click into the Collections tab,

19
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:50.01
and then click on the
Add Collection button.

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.04
Let's name it Reservation.

21
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:54.07
Then, click Create.

22
00:00:54.07 --> 00:00:58.03
Navigate to the field
called Enter Request URL.

23
00:00:58.03 --> 00:01:10.02
Enter in
http://localhost8080/room/reservation/v1,

24
00:01:10.02 --> 00:01:15.07
and then add the parameter
checkin, and let's set it to

25
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:23.08
2017-03-18, then Add a
second parameter, Checkout,

26
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:31.08
and let's set it to 2017-03-20.

27
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:35.05
On the right-hand side, let's
navigate to the Save button,

28
00:01:35.05 --> 00:01:39.02
and click on the Dropdown,
and click Save As.

29
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:41.08
Let's clear out the Request Name field.

30
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:48.03
Let's name the request Get
available room reservations.

31
00:01:48.03 --> 00:01:52.08
Then, let's Save it to the
existing collection Reservation.

32
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:53.09
And click Save.

33
00:01:53.09 --> 00:01:57.04
Next, let's make sure our
application is running.

34
00:01:57.04 --> 00:01:59.05
So let's go back to clips.

35
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:02.05
Click on the Root Project directory,

36
00:02:02.05 --> 00:02:05.05
click Run As, Spring Boot App.

37
00:02:05.05 --> 00:02:08.06
Okay, so now that our
application is started,

38
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:10.04
let's head back to Postman.

39
00:02:10.04 --> 00:02:13.09
Let's click on the Get
available room reservations

40
00:02:13.09 --> 00:02:15.09
request, and click Send.

41
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:19.07
You should notice the status
code is equal to 200OK,

42
00:02:19.07 --> 00:02:21.05
and in the request body,

43
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:24.06
we have a empty reservation response.
