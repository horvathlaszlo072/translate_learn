00:00:00.02 --> 00:00:03.03
- [Instructor] Let's talk
about documenting your API.

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:07.07
Within Postman, you have the
ability to export a collection.

3
00:00:07.07 --> 00:00:09.07
If you mouse over your collection,

4
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:13.07
click on the elipses, click on export,

5
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:17.08
Collection v2, and export,

6
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:21.04
you can export your
collection in JSON format.

7
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:22.06
There are many tools online

8
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:25.06
that allow you to document your API.

9
00:00:25.06 --> 00:00:29.03
One example, is apimatic.io.

10
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:34.00
If you go to apimatic.io and
sign up for a free account,

11
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:38.01
go to /transformer, click on convert now,

12
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:42.09
and upload your collection.

13
00:00:42.09 --> 00:00:44.09
Add a file descriptor.

14
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:48.07
Let's select API Blueprint Format 1A,

15
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:52.01
and click convert now.

16
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:55.02
If you go to a site like apiary.io,

17
00:00:55.02 --> 00:00:57.03
which also requires a free account,

18
00:00:57.03 --> 00:01:00.06
if you open the file you downloaded,

19
00:01:00.06 --> 00:01:02.08
copy the API blueprint,

20
00:01:02.08 --> 00:01:06.02
and then paste it into your apiary,

21
00:01:06.02 --> 00:01:11.00
you will then have a live
documentation of your API,

22
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:12.09
which will describe each end point,

23
00:01:12.09 --> 00:01:18.01
and also the required parameters.

24
00:01:18.01 --> 00:01:19.08
So, for instance, we see our get,

25
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:24.02
our post, our put and our delete.

26
00:01:24.02 --> 00:01:26.01
If you click on an end point,

27
00:01:26.01 --> 00:01:28.08
such as get available rooms,

28
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:31.07
scroll down and click try,

29
00:01:31.07 --> 00:01:36.03
it'll give you an example on
how to call that end point.

30
00:01:36.03 --> 00:01:40.02
Let's add in the check-in
and check-out fields

31
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:42.08
and click call resource.

32
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:44.03
We got a 404 in this case,

33
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:48.09
because we don't have a
hosted URL for our API.

34
00:01:48.09 --> 00:01:52.05
But if we did, that'd be
a good way to test it out.

35
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:54.04
The 1A format is pretty universal,

36
00:01:54.04 --> 00:01:57.09
so you'll be able to use it on many sites

37
00:01:57.09 --> 00:02:00.09
other than apiary.io.

38
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:06.05
Swagger.io also provides
hosted documentation.

39
00:02:06.05 --> 00:02:12.05
If you go to apimatic and
convert your Postman export

40
00:02:12.05 --> 00:02:15.01
to a Swagger JSON or YAML,

41
00:02:15.01 --> 00:02:18.02
you could also host it on SwaggerHub.
