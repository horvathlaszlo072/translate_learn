00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.03
- [Instructor] My name is Chris Anatalio

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:04.08
and I'm a senior software engineer.

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:07.00
I have over a decade of experience

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:10.06
crafting scalable
modular web applications.

5
00:00:10.06 --> 00:00:14.03
Modern application development
is more demanding than ever.

6
00:00:14.03 --> 00:00:16.09
You need to support mobile and tablet apps

7
00:00:16.09 --> 00:00:19.01
as well as web applications.

8
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:22.00
A well built rest API can provide the data

9
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:23.08
to power all three.

10
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:27.00
In this course, we're
going to build a rest API

11
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:29.01
with Java and Spring Boot.

12
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:32.01
We will also build a
responsive modern front end

13
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.05
using Angular JS 2.

14
00:00:34.05 --> 00:00:38.07
We will walk through how to
design and model your resources.

15
00:00:38.07 --> 00:00:42.08
Finally we will go over how
to test and document your API.

16
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:44.06
After completing this course,

17
00:00:44.06 --> 00:00:46.03
you will have a solid foundation

18
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:49.04
for creating a modern, scalable API.

19
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:50.09
You will also have a foundation

20
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:54.00
for building a fast, responsive front end.

21
00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:55.09
Now, let's get started.
