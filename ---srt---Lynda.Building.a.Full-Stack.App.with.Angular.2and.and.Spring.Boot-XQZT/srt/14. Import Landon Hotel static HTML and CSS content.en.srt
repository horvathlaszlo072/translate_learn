1
00:00:01.00 --> 00:00:02.05
- [Instructor] First off, let's add

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.01
the typescript plugin for Eclipse

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:07.03
so that we have proper syntax highlighting

4
00:00:07.03 --> 00:00:09.09
on our .ts files.

5
00:00:09.09 --> 00:00:18.03
Let's navigate to
github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript.

6
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:21.09
Next, let's copy the update site link.

7
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:24.06
Okay, let's head back to Eclipse,

8
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:28.04
click on Help, Install New Software.

9
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:30.05
Let's click on Add,

10
00:00:30.05 --> 00:00:33.04
and then let's copy the update site link

11
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:36.01
into the location and name field.

12
00:00:36.01 --> 00:00:39.08
Click on the typescript plugin, then Next,

13
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:44.09
and Next again, then Accept, and Finish.

14
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:48.09
Then, let's restart.

15
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:52.06
Okay, now let's click on the
project root, and refresh.

16
00:00:52.06 --> 00:00:55.01
Let's take a look

17
00:00:55.01 --> 00:00:58.03
at the angular JST project
files we generated.

18
00:00:58.03 --> 00:01:04.03
Let's navigate into source,
main, webapp, angular2,

19
00:01:04.03 --> 00:01:07.01
source, and then app.

20
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.06
We're going to go ahead
and reuse some static HTML

21
00:01:09.06 --> 00:01:14.01
and styles from an existing
LinkedIn learning brand,

22
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:15.07
landonhotel.com.

23
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:18.01
Having an actual branded front-end

24
00:01:18.01 --> 00:01:22.02
will add context and meaning
to what we're building.

25
00:01:22.02 --> 00:01:28.01
First, get the exercise file
labeled Landon-Hotel.zip.

26
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:30.04
Double-click to extract,

27
00:01:30.04 --> 00:01:32.04
and then open up the files.

28
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:36.03
First, let's open up the
file labeled home.html.

29
00:01:36.03 --> 00:01:40.06
Let's right-click, Open With, Other,

30
00:01:40.06 --> 00:01:45.03
and then STS, or Eclipse.

31
00:01:45.03 --> 00:01:51.08
Next, let's open up the file
labeled app.component.html.

32
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:56.00
Let's go ahead and copy
the content from home.html

33
00:01:56.00 --> 00:01:59.05
into our component, then save.

34
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:02.04
Next, let's copy the image directory

35
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:06.00
and then copy the images
into our app directory.

36
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:08.06
Finally, let's grab the styles

37
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:13.05
from the landon-hotel.css file.

38
00:02:13.05 --> 00:02:17.03
Let's right-click, Open With, Other,

39
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:20.06
and double-click on STS or Eclipse.

40
00:02:20.06 --> 00:02:25.08
Let's copy all the content
from landon-hotel.css

41
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:31.01
and then paste it into
app.component.css, and Save.

42
00:02:31.01 --> 00:02:33.06
Next, let's head to a terminal.

43
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:35.06
Let's start up our application

44
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:38.01
using the command ng serve.

45
00:02:38.01 --> 00:02:40.00
Let's head to a browser,

46
00:02:40.00 --> 00:02:43.05
and let's navigate to localhost:4200.

47
00:02:43.05 --> 00:02:45.00
We can now see our new homepage.

48
00:02:45.00 --> 00:02:47.05
If you scroll down,

49
00:02:47.05 --> 00:02:50.04
we can see the message app works.

50
00:02:50.04 --> 00:02:53.09
This has been populated
dynamically from angular JS2.
