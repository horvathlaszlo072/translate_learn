1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,710
All right, so four, challenge three, it's very similar to challenge two in that the app is just crashing

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,880
and we have to fix the bug now.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,590
Once again, this is made easy by the fact that we get that error right here.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,170
And we could just read this error to understand what's going on.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,430
And as you could see here, the error is pretty descriptive.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,340
So it's telling us that the objects are not valid as react child's react children.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,690
And it's it's given it says it's found this object with these with this keys, if you meant to render

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,780
a collection of children, use an array instead.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,650
So I wouldn't say this.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,280
This really tells you what is going wrong in our app.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,530
It looks like what we're trying to do is render this name of this person in our app.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,550
And we're failing at doing that, so the error is is not really telling us how to fix that, right.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,060
It's just kind of telling us what's wrong.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,370
So as you can see what you know, what we could do is we could read this error.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,140
We could see, you know, we could we could read it.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,780
We could try and understand it ourselves.

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,300
But first, let's just make sure that it's actually happening in our app.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,510
Right.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,920
So trace that stack, trace down and we see it's happening at Applegate's line six.

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,390
So and you could see here, it's also Happe is being rendered from this file here.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,350
So you can you can understand that this is happening in our app.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,620
So it's happening in Apgar's.

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,880
This is Apgar's.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,150
Right.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,210
So you can see here.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,280
So this is our this is our code and it is happening on line six.

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:37,480
So that's how you would find this exact line that's causing that issue now to dive in deeper.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,940
This is definitely a react error.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,480
So if I go into the console, as you could see, we are getting the error coming from so tracing it

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,590
down well.

31
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,530
So the error is being caused by this, by our app, but it's being raised in from this app.

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,330
So it's it's actually throwing that error from react Dom.

33
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,280
So you can make that assumption.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,860
If you've never seen react before, you've never used react apps before, you'd be able to understand

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,360
as an advanced user that this is coming from React Dobb.

36
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,520
So this is how you're an expert in Web development.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,890
You still could figure this out just by understanding, OK, this is I'm tracing this into the react

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,640
on library.

39
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,990
Now, you could do you could so sort of debug this further.

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,490
You could you could search for this, throw on an invalid object type.

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,220
But what's going to really help you, it's going to be more obvious is if you just Google the this exact

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,520
error.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,780
Right.

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,150
So if I Google objects are not valid as react child.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,380
OK, so I've Googled that error message and I see here this first snippet.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,150
Seeing an objects are not valid as Riak child might mean that a few different things are going on.

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,540
It could be because the items are being rendered in the JFK element are objects instead of primitives.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,130
So we're understanding that it's an object and not a primitive.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,890
So if you're not familiar with a primitive, you could also Google that.

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,160
But basically you probably know the solution at this point.

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,420
Primitive.

52
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,280
It should be either a string or a number.

53
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,720
Right, instead of an object.

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,530
So using this, we were able to Google this error and figure out that you shouldn't be passing objects

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,920
in your.

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,100
So at this point, you should know what JSF is.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,290
If you don't, you should definitely look that up.

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,450
But basically the key thing here is that we know what we know what the issue is now.

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,640
We shouldn't be passing in objects in here.

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,790
And so we have to look for where is the primitive object, which is where where is the primitive variable

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,030
here?

62
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,130
And that's name text.

63
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,340
So if I open up that code sandbox here, I can just.

64
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,420
Better see this issue, so if I go here and I just say I could structure this instead, so I could say

65
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,750
you could structure text off of that object.

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:58,030
And put that here and then that way we can fix the issue, so another thing I could have done was if

67
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,100
I roll this back, I could have said name text to get that string.

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,860
So there we go.
