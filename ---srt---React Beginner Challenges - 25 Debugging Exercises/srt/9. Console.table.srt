1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,320
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,140
So in this one, we're going to talk about console table and we're going to use it in a kind of clever

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,270
way to actually see the data inside of this minesweeper game over here.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,750
And by using the console to table command, we're going to be able to cheat and just see all the bombs

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,750
in this and we're going to use the console table to actually see that graphed for us here in the console

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,180
to log here.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,910
So normally, you know, you do console a log and output some text in here.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,630
But if you want to actually see some, you know, spatial data, like a couple of nested arrays, that's

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,210
not really going to be helpful for you.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:43,010
You're going to have to, you know, log those out in a series of numbers or something.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,500
And it's going to be really hard to see the actual data.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,990
Right, in terms of visuals.

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,430
So what we're going to do with this, when you use the console to table command now, we could use this

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,250
with objects or arrays.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,980
So basically, I have my app in here on my left.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,600
I have my initial state and we're just going to go ahead and start using this just console on a table.

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,210
And inside here, we're going to wrap we're going to use initial state and we're just going to do initial

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,290
state just so you could see what's going on here.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,370
So right on over here on my right, you could see in the console we now have a table displayed, which

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,140
is really awesome.

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,480
We also get the actual object here.

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,770
Normally, if you just did console a log, you get this.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,920
So you could see here we have a grid, which is an array of res.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,080
And in here we have this table.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,610
Now, you could see the grid.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,750
It's being it's showing the the arrays inside of the grid.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,900
So there's eight arrays inside of the grid for each row.

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,980
There's eight rows.

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,270
Right.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,370
And then each one of those rows has eight columns or eight cells.

31
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,560
So that this is cool.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
But this is not really giving us the grid.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,230
Right.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,020
So we're going to do is we're going to actually just do first.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,040
We're going to show you what happens if we add another statement here.

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,770
We're going to do grid.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,390
So now we're just doing the grid.

38
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,040
So this this cool, right.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,690
We could see here we have the eight by eight grid here, but in each one we're getting the grid cell.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,710
So you could see here we have eight by eight grid cells and that's cool.

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,160
But we're not really seeing any information in each in each cell.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,430
Right.

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,540
So how would we actually see the information in that cell?

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,840
Well, what we could do is we could map over that data and just log a new type of data.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,180
So log a map over that data with whatever we want to display.

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,110
So if we want it to display whether they had a bomb or not, we could do that or the number inside.

47
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,310
So if you go back here to components, you could see over here we have the cell and you could see here

48
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,930
we have the different properties of the cell.

49
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,950
We've got the is mine that we've got is empty.

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,270
So you could do whatever you want here.

51
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,110
You could see the value.

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,070
You could see the number.

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,670
So let's try the number first.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,770
So what we're going to do here, we're going to go up and we're going to now just go over here where

55
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,670
we did this table.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,960
And we're going to do instead is we're going to say initial state grid.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm going to do a map.

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,780
So we're going to map over this data.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,970
And in the map function, what we're going to do is we're going to get a bunch of rows.

60
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,270
Right.

61
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,700
And we're going to do is we're going to return the rows, that map.

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,330
So we're going to map over the rows.

63
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,450
We're going to turn another map over those rows.

64
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,180
And inside of here, we're going to end up doing is we're going to say so each cell.

65
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,340
So cell, we're going to map over the cell.

66
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,290
And then finally, we're just going to say cell dot and.

67
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,230
OK, so now you could see something save this, so it makes it easier to see, OK, so it's going to

68
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,340
put it all on one line here.

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,250
So let me just collapse this so you could see that.

70
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,680
There you go.

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,100
So there we go.

72
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,360
That's returning the number of that value.

73
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,310
And as you can see now, we have access to all those numbers here.

74
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,540
So let's just see if that's correct.

75
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,310
So we know that if we click on one of those, we're going to get that number of how many minds are around

76
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,780
that number.

77
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,920
So if we go down here, let's just try and stretch this out a little bit.

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:18,150
OK, and we are going to see, OK, so we have zero, we have one over here and that the let me just

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,710
move this around really quick.

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,730
Let's move this up so you could see so you could see we have right in here, first row is going to be

81
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,230
zero zero.

82
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,890
And then we have the second row, we have a one.

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,270
So if I go up here and I click it, that's a one just to show you, I'm not making this up.

84
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,190
We go down over here.

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,550
This is should be a two.

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,510
Go so that that's the two right there.

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,330
Awesome.

88
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,480
So now we don't have any data about these bombs.

89
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,700
So if I start clicking on the zeros, the zero might be a bomb, I believe.

90
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,320
So if I just start clicking over here on these zeros, this so we've got one.

91
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,400
This is going to be a one.

92
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,220
And there you go.

93
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,820
That's a bomb.

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,650
Bomb a zero.

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,090
So this isn't really going to help me cheat.

96
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,660
So we're going to do is instead we're going to say cell that is mine.

97
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,210
And then if it's a mine, we're going to just put a B or else just nothing.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
So there we go.

99
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,570
So now we could see we have the grid here, eight by eight of whether or not these are bombs.

100
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,360
So there we go.

101
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,170
So that should do it.

102
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,900
So now if we just start clicking.

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
So if I start clicking, OK, I know that's a bomb.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:20,900
Right?

105
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,640
So if I go, these three should be not bombs.

106
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,890
Next one.

107
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,610
This one's here.

108
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,270
These should all not be bombs except for this one on the bottom.

109
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,130
So we know this column over here, this third one in should be all not bombs, this one up here.

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,320
And then we go down here.

111
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,380
This should be a bomb.

112
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,120
So I think if we right.

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,640
Click, we'll flag that flag these two.

114
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,490
And then we go up here, we flag this one.

115
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,940
This is a very fun way to play the game.

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,920
I think it's pretty fun there.

117
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,970
Go down here and that's a bomb.

118
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,230
This bomb is a bomb.

119
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,280
This is a bomb.

120
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,990
And.

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,470
This should be the last cell, so hopefully I'll win the game, so we go, I won.

122
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:12,170
So not very fun way to play, but this is how you use console that table to cheat or to see the better

123
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,980
view of that data.

124
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,910
So thanks.
