1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,240
All right, so moving along to the second part of our Web, Inspector, Chrome debugger, chrome dev

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,650
tools tool, we have here the network panel.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,270
So here basically you could just see the network activity for your site.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,850
So here you can see the different files that have been loaded from the server.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,650
So you have the method that you're getting that file.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,440
So get request, you have the status code.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,120
So the file fails.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,690
You'll see the error here and then you have the type of that file.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,320
So you can see here we're loading JavaScript, we're loading images, some styles and the initiator.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,890
So where was that loaded from?

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,730
And you could see the size of that file and you could click on these to sort these by size so you could

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,720
see the biggest file that you're loading and then you could see the time.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,850
So the time it takes for that to get to your website from the server, you could see that here as well.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,800
And then on your right, you'll see just a time frame of this and you hover over that and you could

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,110
see just more details about that.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,240
And you can see just a breakdown of that.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,970
And then this up here is just across time.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,580
So as you're loading assets, you could see here they some of the assets take longer and then you can

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,990
go and just click record.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,580
And then you could see here you can refresh the page and then you could see all of your assets loading

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,090
after you stop recording.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,310
So there you go.

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,800
So you can now just you can click on sections here if you want to, like, dive in deep.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,230
And yes.

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,890
So this is pretty useful if you're debugging network activity.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,780
I would say the most common thing that you're going to do here is you are going to check the response

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,380
from the server.

28
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,490
So let's say that you load some some packet of data.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,720
So like let's say I load this file right here.

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,750
What you're going to do is you're going to read this information here.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,760
A lot of the times that you can see, you know, the different headers that come back from the server.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,820
You can see the response from the server.

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,240
So if you go here, you see a preview.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,590
This is what the server returns.

35
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,480
You can see the exact content that your server is delivering to your website piece by piece.

36
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,970
So just like with images, you can go here and see different images for things that have been loaded.

37
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,920
And you could go here and see the response if there's a response from that.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,980
So you could see a preview response and then the initiator where you load it, loading that from, and

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,030
then you could see more details about timing there.

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,850
So this is the network tab, very useful for checking out things coming from the server.

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,890
And up here, you could see you can actually filter out some of that data.

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,550
So if you go here and click X once you're in here, then you go back to this menu and you could go here

43
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,570
and filter out.

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,360
So if you only want to see JavaScript or X Chaffetz requests, you could do that and then looking like

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,540
that.

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,170
So you could see here JSON and if you go down here.

47
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,690
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,550
So a lot of times you could see the requests that are sometimes you'll want to debug like what am I

49
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,240
requesting.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,600
So.

51
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,430
What am I requesting with right, so say your app is requesting with some query parameters.

52
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,490
This is where you'll see, well, what am I requesting right here?

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,410
And then you'll see that's exactly what you're getting back.

54
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,910
And JSON data, you can then go and actually browse through the JSON data that you're getting back from

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,550
the server self server, sending you some weird data.

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,590
You'll be able to debug that here, send a screenshot to your back end developer and tell them to fix

57
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,150
their code.

58
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,750
So here another thing.

59
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,160
This is another response.

60
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,210
And so there we go.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,480
So this is pretty much the network tab.

62
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,810
You can also go up here and throttle the network.

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,530
So if you want to have slow 3G or fast 3G or disable Wi-Fi quickly, you could do that.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,580
And over here, this is pretty much you can upload a network profile file.

65
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,330
If you want to see someone else's file, you could disable cache.

66
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,970
So if your network is caching, you could disable that.

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,300
And yes, you could filter, you could clear.

68
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,810
And that's basically, as is clear, the network tab.

69
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,220
It's going to clear all of that data.

70
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,850
So we have.

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,460
So there you go.

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,390
So cool.

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
So now we go back to Profile Tab.

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,030
This is for if you're debugging JavaScript specifically and also more and more information as well.

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,280
So you could see in addition to JavaScript, you can see your network here as well.

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,230
And then you could see more information.

77
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,920
So frames.

78
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,660
So as you load that page, you can see the exact frames that come in.

79
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,090
And if you go up here, you could see as we're loading in that profile, it's coming in or as reloading

80
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,900
in that page.

81
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,840
It's coming in just like this in this timeline.

82
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,310
So here we loaded that image.

83
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:27,130
And as you see here, we have green, purple and yellow and blue.

84
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,200
So sections out your site.

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,010
So you could see here across the the time frame that we're on right now, this should update.

86
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,630
So you have, you know, about a second of information here that you could look at.

87
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,110
You could see, OK, we spent 100 milliseconds rendering 30 seconds painting that to the screen scripting.

88
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,150
You have JavaScript running for most of it.

89
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,880
And then you go down here and you could actually scroll up to expand and then see the actual call stack

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,210
of that JavaScript it calls functions down.

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,370
So each function above is calling the function below.

92
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,230
And you can just zoom in and see different types of you could debug, basically see where your app is

93
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,120
spending most of its time if you have some kind of performance bottleneck.

94
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,760
So that's really cool and useful to do if you're doing some really intense profiling, if you're trying

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,090
to do some speed debugging, this in combination of the network tab are going to get you a lot more

96
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,720
information about what's going on in your app as far as performance goes.

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,120
So then down here, you see the bottom up.

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,460
You can actually see during that time what JavaScript functions were called.

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
So I think you need to.

100
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:37,950
Yeah.

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,710
So let's see if we click on one of these blocks, then you go down and you could see the exact time

102
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,600
that it's been in each one of those functions.

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,630
So we're not going to go too much more into this.

104
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
This is pretty intense.

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,890
We could do a lot more on this.

106
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,180
If you want to do more profiling, we could do another lecture on that.

107
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,850
Just let me know.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,610
So moving along, we have memory so you could see how much memory your app is using across time.

109
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,650
So as you as your JavaScript gets more memory built up, it will show here and as well as DOM nodes.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,010
So there's going to be nodes here.

111
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,230
These are actually your HTML nodes that are being rendered.

112
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,450
So you could see how many are actually rendering.

113
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,410
This is good.

114
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,090
If you have a ton of nodes that you're rendering and you want to just see what's going on as far as

115
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,750
your how your browser is handling that in terms of like what?

116
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,530
OK, we're taking up 11 megabytes of data and.

117
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:27,820
Cool.

118
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,830
So memory tab, same thing here, we're not going to do this, but same thing if you want to get a snapshot

119
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,960
of your memory distribution across time for different JavaScript and DOM nodes.

120
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,750
OK, moving along, we have the application tab.

121
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,230
So here is where you'll see the local data that your app is storing.

122
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,450
So when you have local storage, you have keys and values that are being stored there.

123
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,170
And that's pretty common in apps to have cookies as well.

124
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,850
So you could see a lot of cookies and that's pretty useful.

125
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,530
You have cash, so you could clear cache like this.

126
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,590
You could clear your cookies as well just by clicking on that.

127
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,760
So that's pretty useful.

128
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,170
And so that's the application tab.

129
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,830
This is basically just seeing your application storage and most of the time you're in here just looking

130
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,290
at local storage or clearing cookies.

131
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,650
Next tab is the security tab.

132
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,290
This is a tab I'm almost never in just to show you what it is.

133
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,910
Basically, we are showing whether this page is secure or not through https.

134
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,160
So whether you have an encrypted connection and it's going to tell you whether or not you have that

135
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
server certificate.

136
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,030
So if you want to see your origins that you're loading data from and to see whether they are secure

137
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,310
or not, this is the panel that you're going to do that and not much else going on in here, audits

138
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,460
here.

139
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,710
You could generate a report of your site so you could get a nice speed report.

140
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,590
And this is cool seeing your SEO for your site if you're interested in that.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
So I need to properly size images.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,810
This is the information that they're getting here.

143
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,140
I didn't minified it.

144
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,940
I didn't minifie any of my images here.

145
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,800
And that's probably why I'm getting that.

146
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,240
This is also the same.

147
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,990
This is also the same as page speed, Google page speed.

148
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,360
It's a website where you can go and enter in your website.

149
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,840
So if you want to just do that locally, you could do that here.

150
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,280
And I'm pretty sure there's mobile and there's desktop versions of this.

151
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,690
So this is, I believe, doing the mobile one here.

152
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,020
But there should be a way to see the desktop one.

153
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,240
So this is the speed on it.

154
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,190
And then next, you have your various chrome extensions of my ad blocker, my react dev tools here,

155
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,190
which we'll get into, and then a react profiler, and then up here you have some warnings and this

156
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,440
is just some warnings that are appearing in your console.

157
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,560
So you just have that little warning up here.

158
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,480
And then over here we have some more these things we kind of talked about already, which is the docs

159
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:04,710
side and the and other different shortcuts and other just settings for the developer developer tools

160
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,990
here.

161
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,850
So here is where you can actually enable dark mode if you want to.

162
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,100
That's pretty much the main thing that I've been going in here and doing that I can remember recently.

163
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,810
So the dark mode would be right here and theme, you could change that to dark mode.
