00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,470
All right, so in this lecture, we're going to talk about a super, super common error that you're

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,710
going to get all the time when you're working with react apps or any kind of JavaScript apps.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,880
This is the way to show it right here.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,090
This is the can I read Property Z of Undefined, where this is the object sort of property that you're

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,020
trying to access.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,720
And this error is pretty simple to understand, but it's just occurs everywhere.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,780
And you're you're going to get confused a lot of the times.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,970
But basically what this means is you're trying to access something off of an undefined property.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,780
And undefined is just a type in JavaScript.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,300
It doesn't have properties or anything that you could access.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,690
So if you try and do a dot on that undefined thing, that variable, you're going to get an error.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,740
And that's just a fact of life.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,500
It's unfortunate, but this is just something that you're going to have to deal with.

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,510
What you should be thinking about is, OK, the variable.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,390
So this this really should say foo is undefined and it's kind of misleading.

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,540
And I just mentioned another way that the other variable, you know, is not a function.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,840
Right.

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,830
This should say Foo is undefined.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,690
Instead, it says cannot read property Z of undefined.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,560
So it's kind of it makes you think like, OK, well, it makes you you have to actually think for yourself

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,150
on this one and think to yourself, OK, what is undefined that I'm calling Z.

22
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,240
And if you go down, you look right here, you see food and you knowing this information, you could

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,640
say, OK, Foo is undefined and sort of way.

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,290
The way that you continue debugging this as you would look, you would trace up and say, OK, well,

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,130
I just defined Foo here and I didn't set it to anything.

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,530
And then I said Food Z.

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,640
And and that's all I did, far undefined, so that's how you would fix this error as you'd figure out

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,490
why you're calling something on an undefined object, you trace that back.

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,810
Now, let's say I define FUX to just be a blank object.

30
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,720
OK, now you could probably guess what kind of error I'm going to get now, right?

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,760
So now I get food out.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
Z is not a function.

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,850
So now let's say we define Z and we just put Z as a function.

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,020
And so now we don't get an error because we have food to find and we have very defined, so I hope that

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,550
makes sense.
