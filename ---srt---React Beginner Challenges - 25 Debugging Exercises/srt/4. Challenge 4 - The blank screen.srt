1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,760
OK, so in challenge for we could see we have this issue here.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,480
Now you could see we have the objective, so basically saying, hey, the screens blank, please fix.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,880
So now you can see here, unlike the previous challenges, we don't have a obvious error to debug.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's say if I refresh, so go over here and now if I open the sandbox.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,370
Here we go.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,610
So so now I'm in the sandbox, and if I go here to the console, so you see we don't have an error on

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,220
the screen, but if I go to the console, you could see I do see a warning that says functions are not

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,810
valid as a react child.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,680
This may happen if you return a component instead of component from render or maybe you call this function

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,000
rather than return it.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,470
So basically, that's that's my clue into this.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,010
Now I'm looking at this app and it doesn't appear and anything is wrong.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,280
Right.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,390
But actually what we're doing is we are assessing here.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,910
Functions are not valid as react child.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,820
We are returning a function, whereas we should just be returning that X, right.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,460
So just returning this just like this would fix that issue.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,380
So kind of a sneaky type of error, you know, that you might run into if you think that you could return

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,300
a component like this.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,580
So definitely a tricky issue.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,340
So if you you know, we could Google this error and try and find, you know, solution.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,570
See if, you know, if we Google this, we might get a similar.

23
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,740
You know, so if I go into this code, Kampia and.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,600
So as you can see here.

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,390
This person is just returning that function inside of their JSM.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,860
They're not they're not actually calling that function, right?

27
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,810
They're not invoking that function.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,560
So, yeah, this was kind of a trick that I made just to to try and throw you off in terms of understanding

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,430
why this was happening.

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,720
Now, another thing you could do to get this to, you know, if you really were running out of options,

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,830
you could just return.

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:15,720
You know, go back to revert to a component that does work here, so that is challenge number four.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,780
As you could see here, what we had to do in our strategy guide was we we did read the error here and

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,730
we we followed the stack trace.

35
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,630
There was no stack trace.

36
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,390
There was actually more of a warning than an error.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,720
Right.

38
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,630
So we found that warning and then we Google that error message.

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,370
And we were able to understand through that error message what was going on.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,590
And we were able to fix our code through that.
