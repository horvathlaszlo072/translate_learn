1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,300
All right, so for this example, challenge 16, you could see here, we can't select the option, and

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,920
that is all the information we get.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:16,740
So if we go here to the code sandbox, you can see here that as we click, we are not being able to

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,910
select the option.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,130
Right.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,850
So if we go to the console, there's no errors here.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,160
So it looks like we're going to have to debug how this component works.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,660
So first thing we're going to do as as usual, you can search for this component that's causing the

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,080
issue.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,390
And the way that we do that, as you know, is with the react dev tools.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,950
So we could do that.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,830
But just to keep this short, since we've done that a bunch of times and previous challenges, we can

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,990
just look at this example, which is pretty evident where these things are.

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,260
Right.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,230
So if we go down here, we could see the best, the worst.

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,450
These are labels inside of this component.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
So we can see the pop quiz up here.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,680
So we're in this area right here.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,480
And as you can see here, we have some components that are being rendered, we have radio group, we

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,260
have form control label, we have a button down here for the summit.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,520
And that's all the clues we have about what type of elements were in release of this form control here.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,980
So where are these elements coming from?

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,320
Right.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,200
So if we go up, we see we have radio group.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,580
So right here you could see Radio Group is a material UI component.

26
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,820
And as you go down here, you see we have some form control labels inside of that.

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,800
So form control labels, another clue that may have to do with this or may not.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,300
So form control label is right here.

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,530
And so we have those can those components.

30
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,040
We also have what else?

31
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,880
So we have form control label and that's basically it.

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,450
So.

33
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,930
We also you could see here inside of the forum, controllable, there is a control option which passes

34
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,790
in the radio.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,800
So the radio button is this right.

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,690
But let's pretend we didn't know about any of these components.

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,420
What would we do to figure out how to actually fix this issue?

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,280
Well, the first thing we're going to do is just kind of take a guess and take a stab at where this

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,920
is coming from.

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,150
My guess is because the radio change handler isn't working, it could be related to the radio group

41
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,720
element.

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,820
Now, how do I know where what library that's coming from?

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,420
Well, if you go up here, you see material, you iCore Radio Group.

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,330
Now, really, what you could do is you could Google this.

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,290
If you really don't know where this is coming from, you could just Google the path of that and you'll

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,190
get this radio group API for a material UI here, which brings you here to the material UI documentation

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,470
for Radio Group.

48
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,350
So.

49
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,240
You could see here, you could read about this, so this is an event to function when this happens so

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,020
you can pull out the new value by accessing event target value.

51
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,800
So we have change handler a value the value of the selected radio button.

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,940
This is a good clue right here about what this is.

53
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,660
So we're just kind of exploring the props that are documented here could also go down and see some demos.

54
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,090
So if you click down here at the demos, it brings you to the radio button demo page.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,690
And as you could see here, we have a similar example, right?

56
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,080
So this is working, but our code is not working.

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,000
So we have a similar example.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,640
So so one thing you could do if you remember our strategy guide is that we could return to normal so

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,870
we could actually just see if pasting this in actually works.

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,860
So we we see we can open up that code sandbox here, which is this example which is working.

61
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,300
We could go here and then we could actually just copy all of this in.

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,140
Right.

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,180
And so let's just maybe paste that below.

64
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,290
And you could see here handle change is not defined, so we may want to just stop that because it doesn't

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,560
really matter whether this one works or not, I guess it does matter.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,980
So if we go back here to this, you could see handle changes this.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,090
So we'll just copy that handler as well and we'll just see if we could paste that in.

68
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,350
So we have a value in a set value react hook that we also want to grab.

69
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,030
So let's just grab all of that.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,010
And instead of placing that in there like this, we could do is leave that as handle change.

71
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,250
Save that leave, that is handle change, and then we go back up here and we see we have already asset

72
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,690
value and a another one, right.

73
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,910
So if we go here.

74
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,040
So if we pace that in, you could see now we already have that declared.

75
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,270
So let's call that example value and set example value.

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,850
So we're doing is we are just copying this example into our app.

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,110
So we have this.

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:57,300
So then we go down here to the example value down here where we have this, we say example value and

79
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,670
then set example value.

80
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,940
Right.

81
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,110
But handle change.

82
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,140
We can leave alone because that was the one that was pasted over.

83
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,250
So handle change is the one that we pasted in.

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,560
So we've got to make sure we also copy this.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,170
I'm not expecting you guys to do all of this.

86
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,070
I'm just showing you what you could do if you wanted to just copy that example into your app.

87
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,100
So I pasted that example in.

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,950
I changed some things around because it was clashing with my example.

89
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,170
But at the end of the day, we did actually fix that or we put in a new example.

90
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,230
Now, if I compare that to what I'm doing in this app, you could see I have I'm checking the event

91
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,160
target value and I'm setting the true or false, but that's not what I'm doing up here.

92
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,460
Right.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,970
So why is this the case?

94
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,340
Right.

95
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,440
First, let's just see if this works.

96
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,970
Spoiler alert, it does work.

97
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,920
So the reason it works is because what we're doing here is instead of setting true or false, we're

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,750
setting the actual value of the target.

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,040
And the value of the target is that radio button and the radio buttons, values controlled here and

100
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
the value.

101
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,250
So the value is a texturing.

102
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,520
Right.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
So similarly in here, you could see that this example passes in the value.

104
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,080
So you could do this.

105
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,130
You can actually debug a working example.

106
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,340
Right.

107
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,050
So I could go and set a breakpoint here and check the actual value that's being set.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,230
And then I could copy what I learned here that, hey, we actually need to set the event target value.

109
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,990
I could have made this more difficult by not even providing that for you guys.

110
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,850
But I provided that.

111
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,560
And except I just added a twist of, you know, converting to true or false.

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,460
So this is a string value.

113
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,940
You set the string of the radio button there and we learned that through this example.

114
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,670
But also we could just read the documentation of that a little bit.

115
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,330
We saw the value of the radio group was the value of the button.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,640
But the other thing that we didn't really talk about is the form control label.

117
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,200
So you could research farm control label and you could see here a form control label is here.

118
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,970
It's let's see if it's talked about any more in this article.

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,550
So we're using control F or finding.

120
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,090
So these have labels, so.

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,890
So he could go to the API for foreign control label and if we go down here to value, you could see

122
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,160
the value of the component and things are passed in.

123
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,490
Right.

124
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:22,850
So.

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,650
Yeah, so the on change event, it's the source of the call back, so.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,570
If we go down here, we could see this we use we don't have on control or on change in here, but we

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
do have the change up here.

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,280
So this is a basic introduction to how radio buttons work in material.

129
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,280
You are you have the value that you maintain in the opera.

130
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,880
So you are maintaining the value.

131
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,960
You're passing it in here with the radio group and the radio group is going to know which target that

132
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
you've selected.

133
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,170
So that's this example.

134
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,150
All you had to do was change this.

135
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,610
Event handler.
