00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,200
This video, we're going to talk about the number one mistake, new beginners make writing code.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,630
So most of the questions that I've gotten answering questions in my courses has been really traced down

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,850
to a single mistake that beginners make.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,160
So what is the number one mistake?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,700
New beginners make writing code so they don't check their spelling.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,630
So checking your spelling is really important.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,630
You're always going to want to do this twice or three times after you write code.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,580
This is because if you're texting a friend and you spell a word wrong, it's not really a big deal.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:30,840
Right?

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,730
But with code, it not only will cause your app to break sometimes, but also your app will not break

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,510
and you'll be forced to debug this issue later in a more difficult way.

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,280
So maybe you misspell an attribute or something so you can see case sensitivity matters.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,880
So if you have the wrong case, you're going to have an error.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,190
If you try and assume two variables are the same and matching up your brackets is really important as

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,450
well.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,780
So it's really important to get the brackets around a loop and inside of your JSM correct and misdoing

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,270
the brackets could cause issues as well and compile time versus runtime.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,010
So some issues will occur during compile time when you're writing the code, but also other issues will

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,090
come later when you're when your actual code executes on the browser.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,260
Try it out.

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,060
Can you spot the spelling error?

22
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,270
So there isn't technically a runtime error here, but the console, that long statement will print undefined.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,230
So this is an example of something that doesn't crash your app.

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,240
But it may be easy to miss this because it looks like person ID is defined there.

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,260
But actually, person ID is the local variable we used person person ID is undefined in this example,

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,260
so an improvement would be to name better variables.

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,650
So person name would probably make more sense than a person name.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,780
And if you're going to use a local variable like person ID, you might as well just d structure const

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,900
id comma name off of that person and just use those if you're going to log them.

30
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,620
So just a way to clean up your code and to avoid spelling errors.
