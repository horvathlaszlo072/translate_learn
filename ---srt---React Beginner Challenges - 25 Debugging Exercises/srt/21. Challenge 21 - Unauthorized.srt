1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,700
All right, so challenge 21, this example, as you could see here, it says it shows unauthorized and

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,230
we are unable to access the app.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,060
So the intention here was to get you to debug this without writing any code.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,490
Right.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,970
So if we open up the code sandbox.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:28,110
And we go to the OP in the new window, basically what we we can observe that we're not allowed to access

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,030
this app, pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,590
There's no errors in the console.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,470
But as you can see here, there's a very simple app.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,000
So we could debug this quickly.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,840
As you can see here, it's locked when the react state is set to react to is locked.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,130
Right.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,730
While there actually is no react state, this is a function that we're just creating here.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,080
And what this function does is it actually looks in local storage for an item called lock.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,760
And when that lock is equal to unlocked, it returns false.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,930
Elsah returns.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,280
True.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,820
So as you could see, it's true because if it's true, if we're locked, we return this.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,030
So the objective here is to debug this without writing code.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,210
So we open up our chrome dev tools here.

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:24,420
And because we are looking for the local storage, what you can do here is going to local storage and

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,760
actually add a key in here to.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,390
Be locked, so how to do that is what we're going to do is we were just going to see if we could delete

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,310
selected so we could do is you could just double click in here and just add a new key.

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,930
So we're going to add a key equal to lock and then we're going to double click here and set the value

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,920
to be unlocked.

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,040
So then we refresh the page.

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,800
And you've unlocked the app, so that was the solution.

29
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,240
So what do we learn here?

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,550
You may not know that you can actually edit local storage values by double clicking.

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,700
This is useful if you're testing shared or settings functionality that you know is used in your app,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,740
you can then modify that with the value, you know, here without having to use code to set local storage

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,180
values.

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,210
You can also clear all your local storage values right here.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,730
And then you could see the app then goes back to the lock state.

36
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,060
So this is just an exercise in editing and adding local storage values.
