1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,430
So last lecture, we kind of showed how to click on the stack trace inside of the app and show you how

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,620
you know, how we got that error.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,310
This one, we're going to take a step further and we're going to do something that's going to get you

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,120
to that error even quicker.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,100
So what this is going to do is we're going to open up the webcam inspector and we're going to click

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,980
on pause on exceptions.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,220
So when we have this pause on exceptions enabled, what this is going to do is when we click on that

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,770
and we get that error, this is going to just highlight for us directly in our app.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,590
So we are we've paused on.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
It's almost like an error break point.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,850
So if you're ever in a situation in your app where you have no idea where this error is, you've clicked

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,950
on all these different stack traces or you want to see certain data around that error.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,210
This is a great opportunity to do that.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,550
So in this example, let's say I didn't even know where this file was or I couldn't get to it or I was

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,730
clicking on parts of the stack trace and I couldn't get here.

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,670
If you do this, like if you're in another script, this is actually what you need to do because let's

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,590
say you have an error and a third party library or something and you're clicking on that third party

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,250
library.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,510
But that's not going to that's not going to get you really closer.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,580
It's going to be more difficult to do that.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,970
Instead of doing that clicking and looking through, you could just click this top right here on the

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,790
webcam, Inspector, pause on uncaught exceptions.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,170
And what you're going to do here is, ah, pause on exceptions.

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,810
That is going to enable you to break point on the air itself.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,090
So then what you could do here is now we're paused on this error.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,680
I can hover over it.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,280
I could see that there is no X or there is no function called X, and if I hover over this I can just,

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,620
you know, I can once again see that error right here.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,280
A lot of times you'll you won't know what error that is for some reason.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,870
You know, just another way of just seeing, like, OK, this is where the line is that has that error.

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,210
And if I hover over it, I get that error.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,330
So that is this over here.
