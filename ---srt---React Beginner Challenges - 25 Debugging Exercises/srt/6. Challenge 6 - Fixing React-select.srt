1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,350
All right, so four, challenge six, we see this error that says drop down doesn't work, please see

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,100
if you can fix.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,350
So this is a very short error, short description of what's going on.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,820
And this one, we are going to try and reproduce.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,830
So let's go ahead and open up the code sandbox.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,400
So we open up this code sandbox and we see a dropdown here, I'm just going to tighten this up.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,540
So we see we have this dropdown.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,940
So as you can see, the first thing I'm going to try and do is reproduce this issue.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,610
So if I click, I see a list of states and if I click on one of those states, nothing happens.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,320
So if you're familiar with drop downs, you know that if you scroll and you click on one, it should

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,970
appear here.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,280
Right.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,640
So that's the reproducing of the issue.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,080
So I've reproduced the issue.

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,330
My next step, if I go to my strategy guide, I want to gather clues.

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,240
So see if there are errors in the console.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,950
So if I go back, I go here.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,720
I look at the console.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,780
And I don't see any errors.

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,430
I do see a warning, I see another warning as well.

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,860
I see these two warnings component will receive props has been renamed, and I also see Component Will

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,190
Mount has been renamed and it's not recommended for use.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,360
Now at first glance, that doesn't really look related to this issue.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,560
So I'm just going to ignore those two issues here.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,990
Next, I can see we have a long statement that says selected.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm also just going to ignore that as well.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,450
So I'm going to do here is I'm just going to, again, reproduce and I see that that log comes here.

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,220
Now, that's this looks like there's just a log statement in there that doesn't really help me troubleshoot

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,520
this.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,060
So my next step, I'm going to open this actual app here.

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,900
I'm going to click on this.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,840
I'm going to copy and then I'm going to paste that into a new.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,470
Here, so I have this in a new browser window here so that I am not interfering with any code sandbox

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,790
code, so.

35
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,710
Next thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to go here, I'm going to open up the chrome dev tools,

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,320
always make sure you click and open up a new dev tools for that window.

37
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,780
I believe I had another window open and I have another one behind here.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,300
So just make sure you close out of all your dev tools.

39
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,200
So as you could see here, I'm in my chrome dev tools.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, if you remember from the first challenge, what we're going to do is we want to find this code,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,230
right.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,010
So we want to find where this object or where this dropdown is being initialized.

43
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,160
Now, to be honest, if I was in a real app, I would probably go and familiarize myself with the actual

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,230
code itself.

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,310
So if I go here, I just want to get a little bit of context into what app I'm in.

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,900
Now, if you're in a real app, you have probably hundreds of files and it's going to be a lot more

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,360
difficult.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
This one is, you know, a lot smaller.

49
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,630
So basically you could see here we have a couple of files.

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,940
We have this we have some data.

51
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,680
And, you know, this is the index and then this is calling example.

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,270
So I go over here into example.

53
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,900
And as you could see here, it's a very small component.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,420
We are end up we end up rendering.

55
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,970
So I go down to my rendering function and I see a return.

56
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,960
This thing, which is select now that looks like that could be my dropdown.

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,610
Right, because we have some options here.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,700
And as you could see, I go up and my next step is to trace exactly where this is coming from, where

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,930
is this select coming from?

60
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,830
So if I go up here, I see this is coming from this airport here, which is called React Select.

61
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,380
So that is not part of my code.

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,610
Right.

63
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,770
I don't see anything in here called React Select.

64
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,280
So I have to determine that this is a external library.

65
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,300
I can go and package that JSON here and I can confirm that React Select is a package and this is Riak

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,900
select version one point three point zero.

67
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,440
So this is a version of that.

68
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,050
So very important to note that because this might not be the latest version.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,250
So that is basically I've you know, I found the.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,590
Initialization of that component is the only component in this app, so very obvious, but.

71
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,770
And a real app, if I go back here, this might not be obvious where that is.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,370
So, again, another thing I could do, a couple of things I could do, actually.

73
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,110
I could go in here components.

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,240
And as you could see here we have this is my react dev tools.

75
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,070
Here and I go here and I hover over these elements and I see here, I click on this select and then

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,560
I go here to view source for this element.

77
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,840
And it brings me here.

78
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:48,000
So it brings me select James, so as you could see here, this is happening in the node modules react,

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,210
select, libs select.

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,350
So that is telling me that, OK, this is coming from a library in my node modules.

81
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,720
So not exactly helping me in terms of where it's happening in the app, but it is showing me that it

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,900
is a node module.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,190
Now if I go one layer up an example, I click on that and then I click on View Source for this element.

84
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,660
It brings me here to exampled Ijaz.

85
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,900
Now, this brings me to this example, dodgiest file and it says Source map detected.

86
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,570
So this looks like this is the minified code, right?

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,420
So it's a source map detected.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,970
If I go to more click on that, it's going to tell me to access files via control.

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
So normally in this situation, if you're in a minified code, you do control P or command P and type

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
in the same file.

91
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,330
So Exampled Digests.

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,750
And then we'll find the source map version right here and we click enter.

93
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,940
And then now we have this.

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,430
So we were able to track that component down to this file and then we could find it through here.

95
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,460
And like I said, you could also you could also search for the strings so you could search for a state

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,920
and then you would probably get into the data digest where those states are to find, you know, if

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,260
I type in Arizona, you could see here Arizona will pop up no matches.

98
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,290
So if I type in Alabama.

99
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,680
You could see there we go, so that does pop up here in the source map, same thing.

100
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:28,240
If I click on that, it highlights this option here and that's showing me that this is the options that

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,630
are being.

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,360
Now, then.

103
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,810
OK, so I say, all right, well, I see Alabama and these options.

104
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,540
What's what's going on now where these options used.

105
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,030
So then I control F and I search for options and I see they're being passed into here.

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,130
OK, so at the end of the day now I have the react select.

107
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,990
I know that this is in React Select.

108
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,260
Right.

109
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,300
I know that this is a react select component.

110
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,520
The next thing I want to do is actually understand more about react select because let's say I don't

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
know anything about react select.

112
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,060
I don't know why this isn't working.

113
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,110
And now you could debug this by just guessing.

114
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,130
I could look at these props and say, OK, well I see there's an en change handler.

115
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,200
Maybe that has something to do with it because there's name, there's value and there's options.

116
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,300
So sometimes you could look at these components and you could just guess, OK, well, on change is

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,840
a pretty common callback and most of these really components are going to have that same on change handler

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,180
or the similar on change handler.

119
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,060
And so if you want to just go for it and just guess, you could just guess that that's the issue right

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,420
here.

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,920
And we see that this is traced down to this not handle change.

122
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,900
And as you could see here.

123
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,490
I can put a break point here and I can understand what's going on with that, so.

124
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,200
As you can see, here I am.

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
Setting the stage to be selected, so.

126
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,840
So let me let me actually put a break point here, so first thing I want to do is make sure that this

127
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,230
Handal change function is actually working correctly.

128
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,730
So if I go over here and I click this, I could see if I hover over this and I'm in here, I can hover

129
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,910
over selected option and I can see that this is right.

130
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,740
This is what I actually clicked on.

131
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:12,980
Right.

132
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,470
So this has a label and this has a value.

133
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:25,160
Now, my next question is, well, if that's correct, then why isn't it going back in to my select

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,880
as the value?

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,160
Right.

136
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,590
So I'm guessing once again that the value is the signature for the current value.

137
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,140
So now so that's that's an assumption I'm making.

138
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,480
And I can Google react to confirm that.

139
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,380
So let me go ahead and search for react select.

140
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,760
So search for react select now, as I said before, we were in version one, point three, so we want

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
to make sure that we're in the right version of this.

142
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,440
So you could see we we might be coming from react select version one.

143
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,050
So it's just something to keep in mind in this example.

144
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,530
We're not going to do that because it just so happens that it's the same signature.

145
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,360
But here we go.

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,090
And then we see we have this this dropdown here.

147
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,080
And we we want to just read a little bit about this.

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,430
Right.

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,580
So we're getting started.

150
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,810
We have options.

151
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,570
We have, you know, custom styles.

152
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,860
I'm going down.

153
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,220
I'm not really seeing a whole lot of information on the home page here.

154
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,210
So if I go to props, though, you'll see some props here.

155
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,450
And, you know, it's good to just read what's going on here just to familiarize yourself, but once

156
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,480
again, it's not really giving me an obvious it's not really telling.

157
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,700
It's only helping me in terms of what what this actually is doing.

158
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:43,900
Right.

159
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,210
So.

160
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,820
All right, so eventually, if we go keep looking at these examples will eventually come into this example,

161
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,990
fixed options, where if we go here and we expand the source code here, we are able to actually see

162
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,190
a similar code structure to what we have in our app.

163
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,390
We have it on change.

164
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,730
We have a name and we have a value.

165
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,800
And as you could see here.

166
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,590
We have similar we have an on change call back here, and we could just look at the function signature

167
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,390
here, we're taking in a value and we're setting the state of our app.

168
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,000
So we're in a react component, right.

169
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,850
With state.

170
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,010
We're setting the state to that value.

171
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,050
Now, you could just kind of ignore some of what's going on here.

172
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,900
Basically, they're taking, you know, certain actions, you know, certain actions that are being

173
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,770
applied.

174
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm just guessing, you know, if we clear it, you know, you're going to want to set the value to

175
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,580
be something what it was.

176
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:40,870
Right.

177
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,900
So but at any rate, the value is being set here.

178
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,860
So we get so basically they they say order options.

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,890
And as you could see, we go up here, that order option.

180
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,370
So we're just tracing in what is this value and what are we setting on our app.

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,500
So values.

182
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:07,960
So it passes in that so it turns value into values appear and then it filters that array.

183
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,100
So you could see that it is an array, right?

184
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,740
Because you know, that values that filter filters an array.

185
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,740
You can only call filter on an array.

186
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,010
So value is an array.

187
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,280
We've determined that.

188
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
And then now we set that array on the app, so.

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,200
We we can kind of just guess, OK, well, this is a speech we also see here we see is multi.

190
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,350
So this is a multi select component.

191
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,640
Right.

192
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,510
And this is all kinds of different, you know, locked values, as you could see, were playing with

193
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:37,690
it.

194
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,270
And we could you know, we could try and find this component as well and debug it here as well to just

195
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,290
confirm what this is.

196
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,810
But we have a little bit more context of what our app is doing now that we have we see this example

197
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,200
now.

198
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,950
You could see here we do pass that value in this that state, that value.

199
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,560
And the value here is just this, that state value that we set here.

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,950
Right.

201
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,930
And just like up at the top, you could see here, state value here is order options as well.

202
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,210
So it's again, it's an array.

203
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,010
So we've got a lot of clues.

204
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,790
Now, you could see here that more more details about that.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,410
So color options.

206
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,150
So if you go up here to color options, you'll see data.

207
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,410
So now let's OK, we have data here so we could even go into here and the this code sandbox and see

208
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,250
if this happened.

209
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,740
OK, so this is a 404.

210
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,700
So once again, the documentation on these things is not going to be always perfect.

211
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,770
And that's why I included this example, because it's just, you know, react select.

212
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,700
Do they upgrade things?

213
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,420
They break stuff.

214
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,010
The code sandboxes don't work.

215
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,140
You're not going to be in a perfect sunshine and rainbows environment always.

216
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,400
Right.

217
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,120
So we have a clue.

218
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,480
We have this clue about what's going on here, about what these do now.

219
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,050
And we see we have a working example we could play with over here.

220
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,100
So we go back to our app and once again we go and we check.

221
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,120
So still it's working.

222
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,910
It's not working.

223
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,260
So we go back here and we we're going to put a breakpoint here in this handle change function.

224
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,180
So we go back to our browser where we had that example open and we go and we once again, we find that

225
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,250
component and we do what we were about to do before.

226
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,400
Right.

227
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,970
We put a breakpoint here and then.

228
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:26,410
What we do is we will trigger this change event, so now that we know where we might be expecting an

229
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,230
array here, right.

230
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,330
So we go and we look at this and we say, OK, this is an array.

231
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,100
So now we notice that it's actually an array, it's on an object.

232
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,100
And we we know that we could pass that array into the value here.

233
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,450
So we say, OK, well, what's going on there?

234
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,110
We are setting in the state to selected and we're setting that.

235
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,180
So we should be expecting this that state that's selected.

236
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,450
Right.

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,420
So if we put a breakpoint here and we look at what selected option is, we see that it's nothing.

238
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,770
It's just an empty string.

239
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,830
So it didn't look like that.

240
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,550
We actually set that on our state.

241
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,870
So this is actually not a react select issue.

242
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,250
It looks like it looks like it's an issue with our app.

243
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,270
So what we need to do is figure out how to set the stage to be selected option.

244
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,580
So what we did.

245
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,480
So I'm going to reveal the solution now.

246
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,790
The solution here is that we that this not set out state selected here.

247
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,020
This was a mistake.

248
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,800
We only wanted to set selected option, not selected.

249
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,310
So we change that to be selected option like this, which means this is the key and the value.

250
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,540
Right.

251
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,270
This is the key.

252
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,100
Select that option, which should be set as the that state that selected option.

253
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,760
And then we go back to the dropdown and we could see that it's now working.

254
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,690
So what did we learn here?

255
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,070
We learned to debug the component, look at the examples for react select or the component that you

256
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,450
want to research.

257
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,560
Look at their examples.

258
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,350
Make sure you're on that right version.

259
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,950
We were actually looking at a more later version of that, but you could also, you know, search for

260
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,520
a react select version one.

261
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,290
And just so happens that they have documentation here for version one.

262
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,170
So and then once again, this is actually a simpler example.

263
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,030
But if we go here to source of that, we could see once again we would be able to figure out, you know,

264
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,160
we have value we have on change here.

265
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,580
And it's a similar example.

266
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,160
Now, you also might be wondering, why are you showing me this?

267
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,720
It's not react hooks, right?

268
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,250
This is a class based component.

269
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,770
So this I included this in here for a couple of reasons.

270
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,990
You're going to want to eventually you're going to run into legacy react code at some point.

271
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,090
And so it's important to know about legacy code and legacy components debugging.

272
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,950
These are going to really make you skilled because you're going to be able to troubleshoot older code

273
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,020
and that's going to really apply to newer code as well, because you're going be able to port older

274
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,730
code to another newer code and you're going to be able to understand what's going on in this example.

275
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,950
It didn't even have anything to do with this.

276
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,390
Actually, we were doing this right.

277
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,820
We didn't change anything with the initialization.

278
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:09,310
All we did was we just noticed that we were trying to set state to a state variable that we didn't use

279
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:09,940
anywhere else.

280
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,860
So we didn't use this that state that selected anywhere.

281
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,850
So basically, all I did was to create this example.

282
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,210
I just tried to throw you off by setting a state to a variable we weren't even using.

283
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,070
So I hope this was useful.

284
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,460
I'm sorry if that was confusing, but this hopefully allowed you to gain some insight into troubleshooting

285
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,580
more complicated dropdown components.
