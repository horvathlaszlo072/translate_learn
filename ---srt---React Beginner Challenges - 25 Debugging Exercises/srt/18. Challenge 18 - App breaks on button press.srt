1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,830
All right, so challenge 18, as you can see here at breaks on button press, please see if you can

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,180
fix.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,360
So as you could see here, this example is a class based component.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,850
We're going to go over here to this example.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
And I included this class based component here because there's probably other class in the other sections

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,780
in this course.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,930
But I did include classes because REACT still is supporting class based components.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,480
And if you're ever on the job or you're getting a job, you're going to be working with code.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,750
Most likely that's class based components.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,740
Honestly, it's you know, where we are right now.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,120
Not everyone has converted their whole code base to Hooke's and most haven't, actually.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,020
And so you're going to be dealing with these types of components.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,970
And I included this in here because it's a really common example of an issue that you'll encounter with

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,150
class based components.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,830
So if I go here and I click explode, we get this or this, that set state is not a function, so.

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,070
The issue here, and this is, you know, it's going to be happening in Europe, right?

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
We know where it's happening.

18
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,360
It's right here on the explode method.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,440
The reason this is happening is because we are passing in this call back into this kallick handler.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,640
But the problem is that this is not being defined here.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,990
So this is super common scenario where you pass in a callback and then the callback is called in the

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,290
context of a new function that doesn't have this current this object, which is in classes.

23
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,120
You have the this parameter.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,640
Right, to reference the current instance of this class.

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,530
And instead, what you need to do is you need a way to bind this function to the this parameter and

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,400
the way that you do that.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,330
There's two ways to do it.

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,320
You could do it in a constructor where you say this dot set state or this, you know, you define this

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,650
to explode equals this dot explodes behind this.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,740
But the easier way to do that is you can just add in an arrow function here like this, this syntax.

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,650
So it's that it's defining this method on this class and it's binding this function so that it's always

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,460
bound to this parameter.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,860
So if I click this, we get the expected solution there.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,810
So how would you have figured this out?

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,460
Well, you could just Google that error that we had before this thought.

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,370
This that set state is not a function.

37
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:32,910
And this will provide more than enough help to, as you could see, the just pages of this exact error.

38
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,630
So as you could see here, the callback is made in a different context.

39
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,460
Need to bind to this, just like I said.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:47,410
And as you could see here, this is so what this person's doing here.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,070
So as you can see here, this is a way different example.

42
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,850
But what they do is they bind to this like that, so.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,280
This is an older example, as I say, when you're dealing with react, you're going to be encountering

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,960
all these old stack overflows.

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,080
And so, you know, this may not have helped you, but this might have this example.

46
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,690
So constructor superprofits.

47
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,580
So you always call a super on the props in in react.

48
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,660
You're going to want it because you're extending in and ethics classes.

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,300
You're going to want to always because you're extending a class you need to call super in the constructor.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,100
And then this is where people would then say this dot on klick or this dot explode in our example equals

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
this dot explode up by this.

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,990
So if you'd never seen this before, you may have overcome you may have found this issue by or figured

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,430
out the solution by finding this stack overflow thread right here.

54
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,690
So my example is not going to.

55
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,190
Here we go.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,860
So my example is this.

57
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,310
So Arrow functions are being so arrow functions are automatically bound.

58
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,820
And this is just an example of what I did there.

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,580
So they just take that function and they bind it.

60
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,620
So that's this is you.
