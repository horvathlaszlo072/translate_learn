1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,460
OK, in this one, we are going to talk about a very, very common error that you might get if you're

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,250
doing react apps and that is the is not a function error.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,070
So as you can see here, if I refresh, let's just say you're in an app and a lot of times students

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,470
will be taking my courses and they'll post their code and just say, I'm getting this.

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,810
It's not a function error.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,970
So this is actually really easy to debug.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,270
And I want to help you to understand what's going on and how to fix this error.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,870
So as you can see here, when you click on a mine, so I have this this app here that I've set up,

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,490
if I click on a mine, I get Griselda's X is not a function.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,080
So most likely if you get this error, you weren't expecting to get the error.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,410
So you might be thinking, you know, why is this here?

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,370
What does this mean?

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,620
And your first reaction is to kind of panic.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,990
And that's not what you should do.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,460
You should really what you should do is to actually read the error first.

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,010
So understand what's going on.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,720
So basically what this is saying and then so after you understand what this is saying, you will go

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,250
down here and look at the stack trace.

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,660
So what you have what this is saying ultimately is the same Griselda's X is not a function.

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,630
It's exactly what it sounds like.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:31,460
So this where we're being, we're attempting to call a function called X on this piece of data and this

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,410
function X is not on this object.

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,680
So we have this object here.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,870
If this was another sister error to this would be cannot access property X of undefined, which means

25
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,130
that grid cells undefined.

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:57,260
But this one means that we're trying to call a function called X on this variable, whatever it is,

27
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,860
and this is not there.

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,560
So now you kind of know what that means.

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,940
So in your brain, you'll say, OK, I understand that this is here in my code somewhere.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,930
And I tried to call this function and it's not there.

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,010
So you might think to yourself, why would I do that?

32
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,640
Why would I call this function that doesn't exist?

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,550
And that entirely depends on your appetite.

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,840
A lot of times you might assume a functions on an object, maybe this object has that functionality

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,120
like Griselle would have the X, another type of Griselle would have X, but this Griselle doesn't have

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,480
X.

37
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,480
So you might think, well, what what would I do in that situation to get the grid cell, to have that

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,200
function on it?

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,270
So that's kind of why that error would be there.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,230
Now, let's talk about how you would debug this and fix it.

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,540
So if you go down here, you see right there, you know, this is a really awesome error that it actually

42
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,170
literally tells you like, hey, this is the line that your code of your code that has that error.

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:02,010
So we know that C we could see here that we're we're calling Griselle dot X and that's that's the source

44
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,600
of the error.

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,230
So so we know that X is not defined on Griselle and that might be a better description of this area

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:16,020
and might be better off saying something like Grit's, GRISELLE or X is not a function defined on grid.

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,900
So I think that might be a more descriptive error for you, for you to understand it.

48
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,310
So going down here, you could see that if we go down here where we're going under the stack trace.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,060
So this is the the code that was called before this function.

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,680
So we have our handle left.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,250
Click here.

52
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,900
Even Code Sandbox is going to do us a favor and highlight the error for us as well.

53
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,140
So, you know, with all of these tools and, you know, helping you, it should be very, very easy

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,330
for you to spot and fix this type of error.

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,800
So you just have to focus and look and see what's going on in the app, use the signs that are there,

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,550
and then try and figure out what's going on.

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,560
So like I said, I just pointed to how many clues that that point to this line.

58
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,480
There are a lot of clues.

59
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:12,270
So if you go down here, even in the console, if we go down here, this is really more stuff we go

60
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,870
to see.

61
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,580
I don't actually think that the.

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,550
If go this up.

63
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:27,010
So I'm pretty sure that let's see if we click this, so, yeah, yeah, you could see here that the

64
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,320
code sandbox shows you the arrows here as well.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,890
So you have this error being defined for you in multiple spots.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,460
But, you know, you may not have this simple to read menu.

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,680
You might just be going off this log here, in which case you should be able to click on it.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,180
Normally in the let's open up the this is a code sandbox, Ed.

69
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,480
So if we inspect this and we and we open up, you know, if we actually go up and look at the real Web

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,260
inspector, this is probably more like what you're going to see.

71
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,280
You may not have a react app where you're actually looking at this error menu here.

72
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,700
You may not be in Code Sandbox, you're probably not in code sandbox, actually.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,700
So you're probably going to look at something that looks like this.

74
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,380
And in this situation, what you would do is you would just click on one of these COL stacks so you'll

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,040
see this.

76
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,410
And like I said, you're going to have to come to that conclusion from this.

77
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,910
So all this you know, there's warnings.

78
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,490
There's there's all kinds of things going on.

79
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,470
You're going to have to be smart and highlight and look for an error that makes sense to you.

80
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,980
So this error, because I've seen this error a whole bunch in my in my days that I know what this error

81
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,830
means and only because I know what that error means, I can understand what's going on.

82
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,770
And so that this is a really protip right here.

83
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,010
This is this is something that you really won't understand as a beginner.

84
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,330
You because I like to beginner all this stuff might look the same to you.

85
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,870
Like, if I go up here and I read this, it says, cannot add node one because a node with that ID is

86
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,850
already in the store.

87
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,530
This is something that I have no real idea what is what's going on here.

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,710
Now, I'm pretty sure this might happen because I'm just guessing, but maybe this is happening as a

89
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,270
result of this error, right?

90
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,350
So sometimes the errors come in one after another and you have to scroll up to see the first error or

91
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,310
earliest error.

92
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,010
So this would be like a warning.

93
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,570
We know that this is a react warning, but if we go down here, we see as soon as you see this type

94
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,310
of error where it says some of your code has some some error that looks like this, that says it's not

95
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,470
a function, that's where you can make the assumption that, OK, this is my code and I know how to

96
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,590
fix this because the X is not defined on Griselle.

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,630
So my this is not a real example of, you know, a situation that I would have here.

98
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,150
So it's not the most realistic example.

99
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,570
So I don't have, like, a real fix other than to just delete this line.

100
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,820
So delete that line and know that fixes it.

101
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:09,400
But I just wanted to to make that aware, make you aware that the reason that you get that error is

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,140
once again, you know, so it compiles fine.

103
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,350
Right.

104
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,040
Like there's nothing wrong with the app right now, even though this code is there.

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
So this is an example of a runtime error.

106
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,960
And, you know, just just looking at grid cell that acts like if we logged grid Celldex, that wouldn't

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,070
cause an error because grid Celldex would just be undefined.

108
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,490
It's the calling of that function, the the the parentheses on that undefined variable.

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,950
That's what causes the runtime error, because JavaScript is like, well, what are we calling here?

110
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,430
I don't know what I'm calling and I'm just going to throw an error and break your app for you.

111
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,330
So I hope I did a good job of explaining that app and how you could look at various different ways of

112
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,130
debugging that I didn't actually go into the error again and here looking at the stack trace over here.

113
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,100
So once again, like if you click on this, the topmost place that you're calling that you could just

114
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,860
see, oh, I'm in handle left click and I'm in and I'm calling this function.

115
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,280
Sometimes you'd be in some kind of compiled code, like one compiled code.

116
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,140
Right now we're not in source map.

117
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,490
So using that, you can just click and it'll highlight that error for you.

118
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:24,310
So if I go back to the console, go back here and I once again, I click right here, I just click on

119
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,610
that.

120
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,660
It's going to highlight that exact line.

121
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,980
So then you're going to be smart and you're going to say, OK, what what is?

122
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,770
So, you know, based on what I said, it's calling X and you can come to that conclusion there and

123
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,750
you could say, OK, what do I got to do on Griselle to get X to be defined?

124
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,530
So that's a solution that you could work toward if this comes up in your app.

125
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,100
So sometimes I would be tracing up where this function is actually defined on GRISELLE or whatever data

126
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,600
structure.

127
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,470
So that would be this error.

128
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,910
Thanks.
