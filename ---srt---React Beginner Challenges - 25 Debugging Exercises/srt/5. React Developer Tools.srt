00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello, in this lecture, we're going to talk about the react developer tools, so this is a chrome

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,260
extension that you could download and then have access to look at your react elements similar to the

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,990
elements tab, except you'll actually see the react named elements in the panel.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,820
And that's basically what the main thing this extension does.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,080
And we're going to show you how to use it and install it.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,050
So you're going to go to react developer tools on the Google Chrome Web store where you can just find

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,060
it and install it to your Chrome browser.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,160
If you want to install it for another browser, you can search for it on GitHub and then it'll give

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,890
you instructions on how to install it for your browser.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,440
So if you go on this page, this is going to give you a screenshot here and a brief overview.

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:54,630
There is not really an in-depth guide over here, but you can search for different guides online to

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,710
find out how to use it.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,460
But I'll show you it.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,800
There's not that many features in this.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,260
So compared to the regular JavaScript debugger, this is pretty trivial.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,660
And I would say not really that necessary.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,430
So you can get by without using this.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,290
But I think some of the features in here are really cool and I'm going to start using a lot more of

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,640
these.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,470
So if we go here, we have a code sandbox.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,150
So this is a place where you can actually test this out just because you may be using a react app that

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,520
doesn't support it yet.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,770
So if you go here, you can see we have an app, just a regular react app rendering some components

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,070
here.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,150
And then I have copied the link here and pasted that into a browser where I can see my app.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,370
So Code Sandbox gives you that.

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,220
So if you go here and you just say, Hello, Sandbox, how are you?

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:51,720
And then you save this, you had control s and then you refresh your app, you'll see your changes on

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
your actual hosted app here.

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,660
So this is cool.

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,500
So now we're going to.

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,800
Right.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,380
Click and inspect to get this webcam inspector up.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,490
If you don't have that already.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,540
And what you're going to notice here is that you can now basically see the actual elements that we have

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,020
in our app.

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,300
So we have an element called Hello World.

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
We have an element called other component.

39
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,350
And cool things about this are that this is the the react tree.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,560
Right?

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,810
You're only seeing the react elements, which is useful if you want to see where the react elements

42
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,410
are in your app.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,170
So clicking on these, you get a special panel over here where you can do special things for really

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,890
specific stuff.

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,230
So if you go up here next to that react component, you can suspend the selected component, you can

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,150
inspect the matching DOM element.

47
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,180
So if I click on this, it's going to bring me to the regular elements panel here, where you can see

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,860
that exact element here, which you could see is just a div, right?

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,160
So regular HTML here react components over here.

50
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,200
So this is the end result in HTML.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,340
So go back over here.

52
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,750
The other thing I can do is I can actually I can log this component to the console here where you could

53
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,060
see more data about that.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,920
So I don't really do that ever.

55
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,900
One thing that I think is really useful is you could see the source for that element.

56
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,170
So if I click on this, it's going to actually take me to exactly where that component is defined.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,020
So I define that component here in Jass.

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,040
If I go over here to the components tab and I look at this other component, which is in a different

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,370
file, I can click on this view source and it's going to take me to that file.

60
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,130
And you could see here now I'm in the sources panel, right?

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,290
So here is where I have that other file.

62
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,180
So I knew exactly.

63
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,220
So if you're if you want to debug a react app and see where the files are for those components, there's

64
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,260
there's less efficient ways of doing that where you're putting breakpoints in those files or you're

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,960
you're searching for the names of those files in here like this.

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,140
So I could also just do this and type other file and find it like that.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,800
But if you want to try something quicker, you might want to try this.

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,620
Next thing going down here, we have props.

69
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,830
So here in Hello World, I don't have any props hooked up.

70
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,390
But another component, if you go if I go over here and show you the other components source code,

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,990
I have basically some props here, a default prop that says Component Amesville, which is a default

72
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,620
prop here.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,050
But let's see if we can modify that prop.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,380
So if I go back to the webcam inspector, I can actually then change this prop here and I could actually

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,330
say title and I could just say Joe and I save that.

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,690
OK, OK, so there's a bit of a lag, so then there's that title there.

77
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,010
And so now you could see we have that component with the name Joe.

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,000
So that react dev tools here, components staff is actually able to change the react props for you on

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,640
any specific component, which is really cool.

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,000
So you could try different props out where you could see what props are actually rendered with, which

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,990
is really useful as well.

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,920
So we can copy that to the clipboard here using this.

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,610
And then I think we could paste those in here as a JSON expression.

84
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,510
So that's cool.

85
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,730
And then over here we can copy the source of that as well.

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,300
So if we copy that react source component there, we can go over here and we could paste that in.

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,910
And then that's the source of that app.

88
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,920
So you could maybe paste that into your file explorer to get to that file quicker.

89
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,680
So that's cool.

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,180
And so this also you could go up here and you could click you could just search for these components.

91
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,320
So if I want to search for other component, it'll highlight that for me and then also appear.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,600
You can then you can you can then use the regular inspector here, just like the regular elements tab.

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,880
You can do this and you could see this component over here.

94
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,790
So I have another button in here, and it's not a react component, so this let's just actually make

95
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:35,910
that.

96
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,930
So I added this button in here, right here, so we can make this a button, which we can call function

97
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,610
or button.

98
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,000
So let's just call it button.

99
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,380
So do that.

100
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,420
And we go up here, we just create this.

101
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,150
And we return this button now, what this button is going to do, it's just going to set a style when

102
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,770
you click on it.

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,250
And the reason I'm doing this is so that we could enable the react profile or to see what's going on

104
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,590
with that.

105
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,840
So here we go.

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,710
We have this.

107
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,110
So now we're just debugging more debugging.

108
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,750
So we have this thing is not defined.

109
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,290
So I have this I have a hook.

110
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,510
So we'll just move that hook up here.

111
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,110
So I have a hook that you're using.

112
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,710
You state.

113
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm just setting the color of that.

114
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,990
So as I click on this, it changes the color because I'm setting the state to be something and then

115
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,370
I'm inverting that.

116
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,650
So if it's true, it's then false and then false.

117
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,660
If it's true, it's undefined, it then becomes true.

118
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,590
So then if it's true, it's blue text and if not, it's green.

119
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,720
So why did I do that?

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,740
So I did that so that I could save this.

121
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,440
So it controls.

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,290
And then you're going to jump on over to your link, you're going to refresh and now we see our real

123
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,880
component.

124
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,150
So you go see if you're not seeing all your real components, maybe they're just regular HTML components

125
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,350
and you didn't know that.

126
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,180
And I have that react component there.

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,210
Now, another thing you'll notice is really cool.

128
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,380
You have that hook here.

129
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,980
So you could actually see the hook defined there.

130
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,150
And as I click on the button, it's now changing the state.

131
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,310
So you can see here that state of that hook is true or false.

132
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,950
So isn't that cool?

133
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,060
Really awesome.

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,240
Right?

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Snakey debug state in addition to props.

136
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,000
So that's that's all going to share with components tab right now.

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,500
You can you could play with this, you could do previous searches and you can go up here, you can also

138
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,670
do the light theme.

139
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,550
So you could change some settings up here.

140
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,430
You could change it to a light theme if you want to do dark theme.

141
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,860
So let's go to the second extension that was installed, the profiler.

142
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,980
So this is going to do the same thing, the network profiler, performance profiler that we looked at.

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,770
If you write if you click on this and you click, start profiling and then you refresh the page.

144
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:59,200
That does nothing right, because what this is doing is only recording reactivity, so if you record

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,690
this and then you just click on this button a couple of times and then we go here and we undo that recording.

146
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,100
Now, you could see we have a timeline.

147
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,980
So not much of a timeline, but we have something here so we could see different states, I think,

148
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,070
that were rendered here, and that is where we could step through and see different times of those renders

149
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,790
or different.

150
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,340
Yes, a different time intervals for those runners.

151
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,360
Now, let's go to the interactions tab, let's see if we can see that here as well.

152
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,680
We're going to click on record again, click on a couple of things.

153
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,510
And it's going to say no interactions were recorded.

154
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:50,760
So we go here and we look at the API, you could see interaction tracing, and so you need to do is

155
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,430
you actually need to wrap your app in this special profile profiler.

156
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,800
So you're going to need to actually wrap your app in this specific component.

157
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,680
So if you're interested in trying this out, feel free to do that.

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,320
We're going to stop here, though, because, again, I don't do a whole lot of performance testing

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,790
these days.

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,650
So this is something if you're a power user and you really want to get a full, detailed information

161
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,980
on it, what's exactly happening with your Riak components?

162
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,590
I think we might do another video on this.

163
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,030
So that's it for now.

164
