1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,240
All right, hello.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,410
And this one, we're going to talk about the mobile debugging right here so you could toggle the device

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,220
on right here.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:16,080
So when you click on this, you'll see that your sight kind of turns into this phone shaped, basically.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,000
So if you go back to my site here, you could see that I am.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,860
Basically showing the iPhone, so if you go up to the top here, you'll see the device that you're running.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,900
So you could see you could choose from a couple of different types of phones or tablets.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,140
So here I could choose an iPad if I want to, and it'll render it like an iPad, which is cool.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,260
And then I could click around like I'm in like I'm on an iPad.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,570
And here you'll see the zoom here.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,010
So the zoom is 50 percent.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,660
I could change that to 100 percent.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,310
So this would be more life size.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,780
And then I can also zoom in more if I want to make it zoomed in more.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,810
But you'll see up here, this is very useful, the pixel count.

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,750
So if you're doing media queries, so you actually want to target specific access, you could actually

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,550
set that up here.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,310
So where you can you just know exactly what size devices these are.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,360
So if I do an iPhone ten, I know that this is going to be a maximum width of 375 pixels.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,240
So that's really useful.

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,220
And here you could throttle mobile speed also if you want to see how slow or fast your website is.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,690
So I did low end mobile, so my site's going to load really slow.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,690
So there you go and then I do online, so here, if I do responsive, this is another more free form

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,120
way to check responsiveness.

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,220
So here as I change this now, you could.

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,900
Now, if you do in a normal browser window, what you're going to get, you get stuck right here at

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,860
about 500 pixels, I think.

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,120
So usually it tells you if I undo this.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,610
So see up here this top.

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,340
Right, you're going to see that here where it's going to tell you exactly how wide your browser is

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,610
and that's going to go away.

32
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,820
So I believe this is about 500 pixels.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,340
It see, it locks you at 500 pixels.

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,400
It can't go further than that.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,460
So if you want to actually debug your iPhone, believe it or not, you can only do that by going in

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,960
here and clicking this phone and then you can go in a responsive and then you can see how your device

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,640
looks on a phone that's as wide as you want.

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,460
So I recommend keeping this on iPhone and then just doing iPad as well.

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,230
Just getting a couple good breakpoints in.

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,160
And that's how I would debug a mobile responsive website.

41
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,150
So that's all I do with this device toolbar here.

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,040
I just toggle it on and then I check my breakpoints and I check different things on your phone.

43
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,980
This is only going to do certain things.

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,580
It's not going to actually render native functionality like native iPhone controls or native iPhone

45
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,830
widgets or anything like that.

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,750
It's not going to emulate everything on an iPhone.

47
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,730
It's just to see your width.

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
And that's pretty much it.

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,140
And there's probably other stuff that does, too.

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,940
But don't fully rely on this.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,190
Always go and actually test on a real device.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,940
So that's the best advice I can give you there.

53
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,400
So when you're done, you can just untangle it and then you're in dev tools again and you're good.

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,890
So that's mobile, responsive testing.
