00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,310
Welcome to React Beginner Challenges, 25 debugging exercises from React School.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,890
Welcome to the course.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,150
Thank you for enrolling.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm so excited to welcome you to this course and I just want to say that I'm here to help you succeed.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,250
So feel free to ask questions on any of these lectures.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,990
First of all, I'd like to just go over the course structure so the course is divided into two sections,

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,370
the debugging strategy section and the React Challenges section.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,850
The first section debugging strategy just goes over a lot of the tools and techniques that I've learned

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,060
over the years to help you understand how I debug in a professional environment.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,730
And then the second section is the REACT challenges, which is 25 challenges that allow you to use those

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,500
skills that you learned in the first section.

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,990
So you don't have to follow this course in order.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,560
It's not like my other courses where we have a big application that we build throughout the whole course.

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,960
Instead, this time around, we're just going to each lecture is really more its own thing.

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,370
So there's there's the first section where each each lecture is more or less a different tool or technique

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,770
that you could use to help yourself debugging.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,480
And then the next section, the challenges section, each challenge is its own thing.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,760
So you could really skip around if you want to.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,440
But I advise you to just go in order just because they kind of build on each other.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,500
But they also at the same time are their own standalone videos.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,760
So first, to unlock the challenges, you're going to want to go to react at school, slash challenges,

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,860
slash, unlock, and this is really going to unlock the course content on the website.

23
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,430
So this content is private, so try not to share this link.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,370
You can access the challenges here, react at school, slash challenges, slash one slash to all the

25
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,420
way up to 25.

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,730
And so the website, you can use that to see the code sandbox link as well.

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,110
And so, yeah.

28
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,440
So each challenge, it's kind of like a brief prompt about roughly a bug and then the code sandbox with

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,740
the app that you need to debug and your objective there is to really understand the complaint and to

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,770
return the application to a functioning state.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,700
Always open the code sandbox in a new window, so I show you how to do that in every one of the challenge

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,040
videos, so don't really write a lot of code in the embedded sandbox because it can get kind of buggy

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,380
and sometimes you won't be writing code.

34
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:30,510
Most of the time you will be, but often a couple of times you will end up needing to debug the browser

35
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,310
instead of the actual code sandbox.

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,550
So we'll explain that as we get to those challenges.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,400
And then please watch the next lecture to understand the philosophy behind these challenges and what

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,630
your true goal is within these course.

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,780
So this video is just kind of to set you up about what you need to know about the challenges.

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,450
Let's go into the next video now, where I'm going to share a little bit about the philosophy of debugging

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,050
and why you should feel good about taking this course.

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,760
Good luck and happy debugging.
