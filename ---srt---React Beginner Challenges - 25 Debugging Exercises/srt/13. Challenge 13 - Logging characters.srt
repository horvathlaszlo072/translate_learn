1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,600
All right, so in this example, Challenge 13, it says this should log keys pressed, so let's go ahead

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,550
in this input and start typing around.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,250
And you could see here it's not logging the right characters, right.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,580
So we open up this sandbox.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,950
We could start editing this.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,860
Now, if you were involved in any of the previous challenges, you know that this is a synthetic event

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,560
right here, right on key press.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,150
So already we could see this is a pretty simple example that's very similar to ones we've been working

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,390
on.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,640
You have an input here which you you could have found by just inspecting the code or looking through

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,090
this.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,240
We were able to reproduce the issue here.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,960
We have no errors in the console in this one.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,710
So, again, this is not something that we could solve by fixing some error in the stack trace.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,810
What we can do is read the code.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,370
And you could see here on Key Press, we are calling this callback here.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,500
And as I said, this is a synthetic event which isn't being used and key press is being set to a question

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,740
mark.

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,140
So we're going to want to edit this code.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,760
So we've identified the root cause, right.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,450
Or setting the key pressed to be a question mark character.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,390
And if we type in here, you could see it adds more question marks.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,380
So if we get rid of it, it still just keeps adding them on.

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,600
Right, because it's adding them on to the array.

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,230
So we don't need to mess with this at all.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,700
We're just going to want to stick to this.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,830
So the question that you are going to pose yourself now or you should have posed, if you're not familiar

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:34,680
with this, is how do I get the character from a synthetic event or how do I get the typed character

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,040
or the event's target character?

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,300
Right.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,370
So this refers to the input right on Key Down is going to be an event handler for an HTML.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,020
And what is the signature of that going to be in react world to synthetic event?

33
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:58,140
So what would be a good Google search here would be synthetic events, character types or key types.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,510
Right.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,440
But let's say character typed.

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,390
And then if we look at this first one, you could see it should alert when enter.

37
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,520
So as you can see here, they're questioning about this event code.

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,070
And as you can see here.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,060
Event Dorcy works well, so this event Dorcy gives you enter, which looks like exactly what we want

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,880
to typewrite, we want to type the key so event.

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,500
And then as you can see here, we have the input with a similar event handler on key press.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,740
And this is passing in the event just like we are, but it's using event Darcie.

43
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,600
So that would be our first thing would be to try E Docky.

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,200
You save this.

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,280
We clear this and we've seen how we get the key, so it's backspace, clear that up.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,080
And we type Hello World, and it's being it's doing exactly what we expect, right?

47
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,430
It's adding in whatever key that we typed and this would work for shift enter.

48
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,490
So this is a really useful thing to know, which is event, if you're looking for the name of the key

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,290
types, you could just use Iraki.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,170
You could also use EKI code, which is the number.

51
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,650
But I like using the string of the character better.

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,780
So that's this one.

53
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:23,490
If you want to use like single keys, only what you could do is just do you know if if idot key is greater

54
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,140
than or equal length is greater than one, you could return.

55
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,220
This was the original question and I was going to have you do this, but this is not really the best

56
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,940
solution for this, where you're filtering out the shifts and enters by checking if the key has a length

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,510
greater than one.

58
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:39,720
Right.

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,140
Because so if I type E or if I type backspace, it's not going to appear there.

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,120
So if you got that, that's a bonus point, but.

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,260
You know this I made this vague enough so that if you added in backspaces or enter or shift, they could

62
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,330
appear there and you would still technically pass the challenge in my book.

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,480
So if you did this, this is a bonus point.

64
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,050
This is just checking the key length.

65
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,140
So only single spaced.

66
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,410
Correct.

67
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,910
Are only single characters would be logged in this example.

68
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,390
So that's this challenge.
