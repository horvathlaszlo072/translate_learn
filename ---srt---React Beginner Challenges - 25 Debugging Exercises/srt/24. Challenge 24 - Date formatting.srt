1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,580
All right, so here we are on challenge 24.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,480
You could see here it says date is not formatting correctly.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,710
I want the chip to display as the form same format as the date input.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,400
Can you help?

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,890
So with this challenge, the objective here is to basically change this chip text to be the same format

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,400
as the date picker's format.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,350
And this way you'll be able to change the date and you'll see that updated here.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:36,250
But in this format, as you could see here, it currently does update to the same format or the same

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,540
date, it looks like.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,360
But this format is not the same.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:47,050
So this exercise is really useful when you are building an app with a lot of dates and you're going

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,370
to need to format the dates.

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,800
And this is not really a great format.

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,040
And so you wanted a clean format that looks kind of like, you know, a shorthand date format just like

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,310
this.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:05,920
And so this exercise to get you to learn how date formatting works and by researching or reverse engineering,

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,090
how this data input works, you'll be able to understand how formatting works with that component and

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,140
apply that to this component over here.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,320
And so what?

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,760
So let's open up the challenge here.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,320
OK, so here we are in the challenge, and as you could see, we have some material UI components being

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,470
rendered and we have some, you know, a date picture being rendered, of course, as well.

23
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,790
And here's the date pick our keyboard date picker.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:43,220
And so, as you could see, this is the material UI date picture.

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,310
And if you go and highlight that, you could see where it's imported here.

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,790
It's from material UI pictures.

27
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,870
So that's your first clue into what?

28
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,560
To research.

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,770
So our objective here, again, is to figure out how this date pictures, formatting so that we can

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,880
use the formatter over here.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,920
So this is the chip.

32
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,160
So this is what we are and this is what we need to modify.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,450
Right.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,510
Currently, we're going to.

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,170
So currently it's using selected date.

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,480
So that's our first clue.

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,230
Let's go up here.

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,210
This is react use state.

39
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,480
Right.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,150
So this is our state for this date.

41
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,670
So we're initializing it with a new date.

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,490
Now, this is going to be a native JavaScript date.

43
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,860
So you can research this by just searching for date JavaScript.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,620
This is just the native JavaScript object.

45
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,150
So this this doesn't really give you a lot of formatting tools.

46
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,420
Right.

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,250
So this isn't a good.

48
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,390
So you could use the functions here and format the date manually.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,470
But we have date formatting libraries to do this for us.

50
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,040
So that's kind of what you could look into, what material UI is using as a date formatting tool and

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
then kind of copy that.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,770
And that's how we're going to do.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,020
So if we go here, you could see that the date, the JavaScript date is the state.

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,320
So that's what we're we're actually storing the data.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,220
And this is good.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,060
You don't want to store the date has a string.

57
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,400
You want to store it as the actual date object.

58
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,210
And if we go down here, we could see that we are currently just calling to string.

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,450
So as you could see here, I think date should have to string here and it returns the string representing

60
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,170
the date object.

61
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,010
So that's what we're doing.

62
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,500
So we're using the date and we're just using a string here that's not formatted and we want to change

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,790
this.

64
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,300
So this is really the only line we're going to touch to finish this challenge.

65
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,630
But in order to get there, we have to do a little bit of research.

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,420
So it's good practice always to just research what you're dealing with when you see some code like this.

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,050
And so what we want to do here is now you could first you could search this library here, but it's

68
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,340
just easier to just search for material UI date picture like this.

69
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,240
So you search for this because we want to know, like, well, what is this using for format?

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,510
Right.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,670
Like if I do this, you can then you'll end up here.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,020
Right.

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,660
So if I do, this is another page that comes up.

74
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

75
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,830
So this is this is really the main page.

76
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:19,310
You want to go to the date time pictures page on material, UI, pictures, components, pictures.

77
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,440
So this is the actual component we're using in our app.

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,660
Right.

79
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,120
Material UI pictures.

80
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,050
And if we go expand this, you could see our exact component is here, right?

81
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,930
That's called keyboard date picture.

82
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,430
Right.

83
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,480
That's the one we're rendering here and that's the one we are rendering in this example as well.

84
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,180
Now that so we found an example that does this right.

85
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,490
But we didn't find we don't have an example of how they use the formatting outside of the date picture.

86
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:46,780
Right.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,610
And that's what we need to keep researching.

88
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:49,820
Right.

89
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,990
So what is this?

90
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,690
So this is a separate package.

91
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,880
So this is actually a completely separate package that we can open up.

92
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,690
And again, this is not obvious from this, but, you know, going down here, this is the native date

93
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,020
picture.

94
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,720
So this is so this is not what we need.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,670
This is different component all together.

96
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,400
So there isn't any more information here about dates.

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,680
Right.

98
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,300
So this is not obvious, but this opens up into this library over here.

99
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,590
This is called material UI pictures.

100
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,370
So this is the library, a special library built for material UI.

101
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,860
And we can learn a little bit about this now, just high level.

102
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,870
We could see it provides this.

103
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,050
And then, as you could see here, any date management library designed to be efficient or zero effort

104
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,840
compatible with moment date functions, luxon and deejay's.

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,630
Now, you don't know what all of these libraries are yet, but you are you have a clue into a date management

106
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,380
library.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,750
And so what this is actually using is so go now.

108
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,560
Nothing else is as useful here on this homepage so we can go to get started.

109
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:12,710
But basically here you could see again material UI pictures was designed to use with the date management

110
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,230
library of your choice.

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,610
So here at this point, you should say, well, what is a date management library?

112
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,310
Which one?

113
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,370
Should we use what does that do?

114
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,600
Does that help me format, right.

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,080
And if we go, we could see moment James is one and here you could see the format with.

116
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,330
So they have formatting utilities.

117
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,590
Right.

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,690
You could see this is basically the main thing.

119
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,830
If you go to their website, this is like one of the main hallmarks of this is that it helps you format

120
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,190
dates.

121
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:49,350
And similarly, date functions is going to be another utility library that provides manipulating dates

122
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,090
in the browser.

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,300
So, again, formatting is like the main thing that you're going to use here.

124
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,480
And so, yeah, that that's basically it, you could read more about this, but so now we know what

125
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,870
date management library is and how it's being used sort of with this date picture library.

126
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:13,650
So the date picture library is using a date management library to format the date.

127
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,770
So this is a this is a library just for date pictures, right?

128
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,330
It's not a library for formatting dates, but it uses a date formatting library.

129
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,460
And so now we know that we could see that they tell you how to set it up in your app.

130
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,230
And this is your first clue here.

131
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,900
Another clue, which is date functions, utils here.

132
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,620
So they pass in that.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,000
So as you could see, tell the peckers which date management library it should use with the provider.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,760
So, you know, react provider's context.

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,170
They you you wrap your app with this and then you won't you know, this this date picker knows what

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,880
date management library to use.

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,980
OK, so we know that material UI material, UI pictures, utils provider uses this data manipulation

138
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,730
library here.

139
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,450
And then if we go to usage we could see that it says choose your library.

140
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,630
So as you can see again, it's the same same example.

141
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,760
Right, we have the utility library here.

142
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,240
All right.

143
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,010
So now we can go back to our example.

144
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,260
We know that this provider's here.

145
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,480
And so let's go ahead and see if we have that.

146
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,050
And we do.

147
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,800
We have this provider here and you could see we are using the same one.

148
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,850
And the examples date functions, utils.

149
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,560
So if we go up, we could see it's date date functions.

150
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:38,700
Now I want to get into date IO, but basically at Wrap's data is a wrapper around all these utilities

151
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,980
to make the same, to make the functions the same.

152
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:51,090
And but then you could see here we have date functions, utils and then you could see over here we're

153
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,360
using, we're importing from date functions so.

154
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,980
This is a clue that I left in, so we hover over format, you could see format is declared, but its

155
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,140
value is never read.

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,830
So I included this in here as a clue as like, hey, you should be using this format function here.

157
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,320
And that's what we could use.

158
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,560
Right.

159
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,340
So we can use this function from day functions.

160
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,500
Now, we can research date functions a little bit more to understand how they actually format.

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,220
And if you go here and to date functions, this is their home page.

162
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,840
But if you search date functions, format, search for that.

163
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,260
You can see here that this is right in their docks, there's a page all about formating, and if we

164
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,710
search for a format, you could see that they are importing format here.

165
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,500
And then if we see usage, you can see right here on their main getting started page.

166
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,880
So this, you know, isn't really that obscure of an example, right.

167
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,900
We're just formatting a date to accommodate format.

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,770
And this is the solution right here.

169
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,270
Basically, we need to use the format function from date functions to format the date, and that's basically

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,450
it.

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,940
Now, you could accomplish this challenge by using a different date, format and library.

172
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,820
But the completed state is to use this format function that's already imported here.

173
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,250
And you're going to import that right here and you're going to use that right down here.

174
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:31,570
So if we go here to, again, the format examples right here, you could see they use this and then

175
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,060
they pass in the formatting string right here.

176
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,290
And this is the string that we want to format.

177
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,830
This is the pattern that we're going to tell it to match.

178
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,590
And you could see all kinds of different patterns there.

179
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,200
Like if you go to format here, you could see all kinds of different examples.

180
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,380
So you could get any of these types of outputs if you wanted to.

181
00:10:52,100 --> 00:11:01,400
So the solution is to use the format function here and get rid of this two string because we want the

182
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:07,400
raw JavaScript date, right, and then pass in the formatting string and then close the parentheses

183
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,850
like that.

184
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,080
And then there we go.

185
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,270
Now, the chip has the formatted date.

186
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,100
And if we change the date, you could see the chip correctly updates.

187
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,460
So that's it.

188
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
I hope you learned a little bit about formatting date and material, you idiot pictures.
