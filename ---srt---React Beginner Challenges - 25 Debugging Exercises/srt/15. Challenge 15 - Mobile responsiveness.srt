1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,360
OK, so for this example, you could see we have tax cut off on mobile, please see if you can fix.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,290
So first you're going to go to the code sandbox here and you're going to actually try and reproduce

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,220
this on mobile.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,390
So what we're going to do is we're in a copy this or you could just open a new window over here.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,190
And now we could see we have this page here.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,790
Now, if you remember our lecture on the dev tools, go to here and say toggle device.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:34,020
So now we toggle the device, we put it on an iPhone or an iPhone X and then we refresh like this.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,110
You could see now that's we've reproduced the issue, right.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,450
We could see that we have text that is cut off so we could reproduce the issue.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
Now it's time to actually go to our code.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,180
So let's actually look and see what's going on in this app.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,160
We have a simple opt out here.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,970
And as you can see, we have some styles that are being imported.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,990
And that is our first clue to see what's going on, because this looks like a styling issue, right?

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,300
This is an issue related to access and we're going to inspect these elements as well.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,980
But just to kind of review, you could see we have styles that success over here.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,760
And this, as you could see here, we have Apple.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,770
We have our app class, which is defined right here.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,410
And this has a bunch of styles on it.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,200
We also have a media tag down here which has just a media query.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,280
So this is your first clue that perhaps this is code that you may want to be able to modify.

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,170
So as you can see up here, this is going to really give it away right here.

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,900
We have 500 pixels, says the app width.

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,670
And if you go here to the react app here, you could see the iPhone is only 375 pixels.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,200
So good to troubleshoot the root cause, right?

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,370
Why is this happening?

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:02,230
It's happening because the iPhone up most 375 pixels and we're telling it to render an element much

28
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,830
bigger than that.

29
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,580
Could also go ahead and inspect these elements on the page.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,320
And you can see that if we hover over one of these, we could see we have that width right here.

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,140
Now, what happens if we just get rid of that width?

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,710
Well, that looks like it fixes it, right.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,990
But what is the actual default property of that width and how do we set that on the mobile version?

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:30,430
Well, if we go here, we could look at width and we could see here that it set to 355 pixels.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,500
So not an exact access property.

36
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,300
But what you could do here is we could look at this and we could just look at other properties.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
We could set we could also set auto.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,210
So let's try that.

39
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,110
That looks like it works.

40
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,390
Right.

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,930
And then also we could look at different types of things we could set here, Max, content and content.

42
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,270
Not all of these are available on all the browsers.

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,040
But another thing that I'd recommend you could do is also just 100 percent right.

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,190
So that's just going to set the width 100 percent, which is what usually you'd want to do that and

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,460
then you'd have maybe some margin or padding around that box.

46
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,540
So either 100 percent or auto would fix this.

47
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,700
I believe auto is the default property of width, but let's confirm that width CSFs.

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,160
We we just search that we can go here to three schools or Mozilla.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,990
We're going to go to Mozilla and you're going to want to search for default by default.

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,120
That's the width of the content area.

51
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,490
As you can see here in three schools.

52
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,830
They say it more directly, default value is auto.

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,450
So what we're going to do here is go back to our app.

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,690
And in this media query you could see here, the background color is supposed to be blue at this point,

55
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,730
but this is not correct.

56
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,360
What this.

57
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,140
So what we meant to do is actually put a CSR selector in here.

58
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,420
Right.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,900
So this is actually your second clue that if you just were to type CSR in here, it wouldn't work because

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,540
you didn't actually specify the DOT app access selector.

61
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:58,820
Right.

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,220
So that's another clue that if you got that far, maybe you figured out to put success in here, but

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,900
you didn't actually wrap this with the component.

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,680
So now if we save this, let's actually put that with auto in here as well.

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,620
Save that.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,040
OK, now, if we go back here to this, we could see now it's actually working and if we get rid of

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,440
that, we change this to responsive.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,640
You could then see as we go down, we get blue and then with changes.

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,670
So after, as you can see here, between the 400 and 300.

70
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,140
So, yeah, it does after 400 pixels, it will it will change that.

71
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,700
But between 400 and 500 pixels, it's still going to be a little cut off.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,240
But it looks like it's still it's fine there, so.

74
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,300
Well, it's only fine because we're doing it live.

75
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,570
If you refresh on this width, it would still be cut off.

76
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:51,790
Right.

77
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,530
So the other thing that you could do is actually change this to be after 500 pixels, then we go and

78
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,160
we change this to the auto.

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,140
So let's try that again.

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,280
So we refresh now at 418, it does work.

81
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,850
So not always.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
You can always rely on stretching it live.

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,500
You always are going to want to refresh the mobile version of that.

84
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,630
So that would be the solution to this issue.

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,590
You can also get rid of the blue if you want, but yeah, that's the solution.
