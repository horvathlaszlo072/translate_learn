1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,880
All right, hello.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,670
And this video, we are going to be talking about the Web kit inspector, so if you're a JavaScript

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,460
developer or react developer, you need to know about the webcam inspector, because it's going to help

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,170
you a lot when you're debugging your apps, not even just debugging issues, but kind of just seeing

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,980
how the app works, looking into various performance things, seeing the network tab, seeing your logs,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,530
viewing source code, putting breakpoints in source code, pretty much anything to do with looking into

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,430
how your app works.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,570
You're going to need the webcam inspector, and you need to and you're going to need to know pretty

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,890
much most of the things I'm going to show you today in order to be really productive.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,190
So with that, we'll just kind of get started with this.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,000
So you could see Hiraman, just a basic code sandbox here.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,010
And I'm just pulling up the webcam inspector.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,550
So to pull this guy up, you can use the hotkey.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,370
John Mac, it's going to be command option J.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,440
And if you're on Windows, I think it's control shift J.

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,030
So that's going to pop up this guy right here.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,750
And this is going to be your Web kit, Inspector.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,480
So we're just going to take a tour through of this.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,570
But before we do that, I just want to point out something you could see here.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,300
I have it in this popped out mode.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,910
You might get it sort of put on the side of your app.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,540
So that's a good thing to first kind of talk about is over on the top, right?

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,400
You can actually just see some of the options for this webcam, inspector.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,070
So you could see here the thing that we're going to first talk about is this doc so you could control

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,530
where it actually docks on your page.

26
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,860
So you could see here I have it popped out onto a supper window.

27
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,770
You may find it more useful for one of these.

28
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:44,800
And actually, I at some point rotated between three of these, depending on what type of app you're

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,310
working on.

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,810
So let me show you what that looks like.

31
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,640
If I click Dock to Bottom, what that's going to do is just kind of put it on the bottom of my page

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,430
just like this.

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,390
Now, this might be useful if you need if you just want it there and you're just playing with your app

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,870
and you just want to go in and see some logs, this is where you're going to have it.

35
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,270
And I think this is pretty useful for that.

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:11,800
If you are looking to debug HTML, that's when you're going to want to go and then you're going to just

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,130
move this a little bit and you're going to want to go to this top.

38
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,310
Right.

39
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,170
And we're going to switch up here and then we're going to change it to dock to the right.

40
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:27,310
So and then we just can kind of move it around like this and then just have it over here on the right.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,110
And what we're going to do, why we do, why we would do that is so that we could actually look at the

42
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,220
military here.

43
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,610
So this is a better view of seeing it, seeing more basically vertical space that you can look at various

44
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,810
HTML elements.

45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,550
So that's why you would have it like that now if you were now, why?

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,440
Why would you have it popped out?

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,940
So let's say you had a lot of debugging that you wanted to do.

48
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,010
Maybe you wanted to look at like a full source of some JavaScript or something or some HTML.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,650
And you you were doing some pretty serious debugging where a lot of times if you have to look at like

50
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,820
a lot of HTML, you would then just sort of maximized that like this.

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,270
And let's say you you wanted also to be able to look at all the CFS panel on the right here.

52
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,550
If you're doing like really serious debugging, that's when you would, you know, pop it out and then

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,170
just have that out here so that you could really take a big look at all of this.

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,600
So that's kind of the three scenarios that you would rotate between where this thing is going to go

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,110
in your app.

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,080
I just kind of explain that.

57
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,400
So for our sake, since we're talking about this Web inspector today, we're going to leave it in the

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,620
popped out scenario.

59
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,990
So with that, let's keep moving on.

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,000
So next thing is, let's just go right into the the elements tab here.

61
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,220
So the first tab.

62
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,700
OK, so now we're looking at the elements tab here.

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,780
And this is going to be you probably already know what this is.

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,630
This is basically just the HTML that's running on your page.

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,910
So this is the end result.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,330
HTML this is not going to show you react elements.

67
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,850
For that, you would need to add in the react components extension, which we'll talk about in one of

68
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,110
the next lectures.

69
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,740
But in this video, we're just going to basically give you a brief overview of this tab here for the

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,250
elements.

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:24,850
So let's see if we can just sort of select one of those react elements in our scene.

72
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,480
So if we go over here, what typically the use cases, if you want to see what success is being applied

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,660
here.

74
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,980
Right.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,660
So as you can see in this code sandbox, if we go to the styles that CSFs that's in this root or this

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,960
default create react, we could just add in special access class.

77
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,000
That's like my class.

78
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,710
And then in here, what we're going to do is we're just going to set the color to be blue.

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,650
So then we jump on over to say that I would jump on over to our app and then we could use that CSFs

80
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,440
class here and let's just say a div.

81
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,090
So we just put an.

82
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,950
Div with a class being the my class.

83
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,220
Actually, that's not a class, that's an I.D. So let's just change that to be a period here.

84
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,020
So that's a class.

85
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:21,590
And then we go back and we made that our class and then we do this and then we just say Hello Blue.

86
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,310
So then we have that blue text here.

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,770
OK, so now let's say you want to see how to actually or what styles are being applied on this element.

88
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,040
Right?

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,740
Do you maybe you have an issue where you need to change this color or whatever.

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,990
So how do you actually know?

91
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,120
How do you trace back that class?

92
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,300
This is a good use case for this element's top.

93
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,050
So as you could see, if we if we.

94
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,350
Right.

95
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,090
Click if we.

96
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,390
Right.

97
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,580
Click this element here.

98
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,580
And we click, inspect, it will pop, it will pop up that element right in our elements tab here.

99
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,620
So then going into this, if we click on that element, you could see then on the right we have a Styles

100
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,160
tab here.

101
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,640
So Styles tab, computed tab and then event listeners, are they like the sub tabs in this window here

102
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,280
for this elements tab?

103
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,310
So we click on that and then you could see all the cows that supply there.

104
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,340
So you could see here we have my class.

105
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,620
This is being applied and you have that color being applied there.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,670
And if you go up here, this is just some one off styles that you can add in if you want.

107
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,640
This is sort of like an optional thing to add in or test new styles.

108
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:37,390
So if I you know, if I wanted to go up here and actually, you know, change this, if I wanted to

109
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,850
change this style up here, if I wanted to say color green and then I go down here and I could see that

110
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,240
that actually changes it, but it doesn't add in any code or anything.

111
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,700
I didn't modify any of the code here.

112
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:55,180
All I'm doing is just giving myself the ability to add in new styles on top of the existing ones.

113
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,590
Now, another thing that's really useful is the computed tab.

114
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,200
So with the computer tab, if I go up here, I can actually see all the CSFs that's applied to that

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,830
element and I can go and look and see where that came from.

116
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,500
So if I click on this, I can click on color and I could look and see, oh, the color comes from my

117
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,050
class.

118
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,030
So if you have something with like a ton of classes and you have no idea where that class is or it's

119
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,210
really confusing, you can just go right to this computer tab and just find the style property that

120
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,750
you want.

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,570
And then you can go and see where that class came from or where that.

122
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,380
Yeah, where the CSFs came from came from this class.

123
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,360
And then where did the class come from?

124
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
It came from this stylesheet over here.

125
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,060
So that's where you can go and click on that stylesheet and then go and actually see the actual file,

126
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,430
which is really useful too.

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,200
So that's going to save you some time into debugging this.

128
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,100
And we went from looking at a Web site to finding the CFS file that has that Silin.

129
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,960
It is not cool.

130
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,760
So very useful stuff that it's very important to know.

131
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,100
So moving on, if we go back over here, we can then look at some of the other tabs in this inspector,

132
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,050
so we just looked at where the sources tab.

133
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,430
Now we're going to move on over to the console tab.

134
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:25,410
So this is where you can see your logs in addition to actually running your own JavaScript and seeing

135
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,050
variables.

136
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,760
So if I go over here and I go back to the code sandbox, you could see I do have a log that I've added

137
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,130
in here.

138
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:40,260
Now, I can also just add in a variable that's like const X equals, you know, hello world.

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,180
And then I can put that in my app somewhere and just put like hello text.

140
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,650
And then I could go over here and I could just put that in here.

141
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,960
I could just say hello text.

142
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,480
OK, and now that who would say that worked, right?

143
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,600
So save this.

144
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:05,070
And yeah, that work, so now what I'm going to show you is, OK, well, we have this log here that's

145
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,150
logged in the console.

146
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:13,500
And another thing that we have that log there and then let's say I want to actually see the value of

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,250
hello text.

148
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,110
This is where we get into breakpoints.

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,330
So and I'm going to show you what this console tab can do when you're actually in a breakpoint.

150
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,520
You can type variables that are at the current scope of the breakpoint.

151
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,580
So actually, first thing that I'm going to show you in the console tab is actually to just running

152
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,160
arbitrary JavaScript so I can be like const.

153
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,230
Hello equals five three, and then I could just be like, hello, and then it's going to be that variable.

154
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,510
Another thing that I do all the time is if I want to just see an array function or something, I'll

155
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,550
be like const array equals one, two, three, just to get that array there.

156
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,590
And then I'm like, OK, what's the function for filter?

157
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,780
And I'm like a radar filter.

158
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,640
And then I know that that's a function.

159
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,860
And then I could just run a quick filter function on this and I'll say and is greater than two.

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,620
And then just like that I just did a little filter function just to show myself, OK, that's how filter

161
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,950
works.

162
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,020
And then I would go and put, you know, this code in my code base after, you know, I've debug that

163
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,120
a little bit, which is also really useful.

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,190
So few are actually in your code base and you're actually looking at some object or something.

165
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,520
You can really easily just know, you know, what what you can not only, you know, see what that variable

166
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,110
is, but you can, like, run JavaScript on it in the console, which is very useful.

167
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,910
So lot we could talk about with the console.

168
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,230
You know, this is where errors are.

169
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,740
This is where you can you could clear the console.

170
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,800
This you can you can just I don't do any of this stuff.

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,290
I don't do I don't really mess with this too much.

172
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,520
I don't like to change the, you know, change the type of errors or anything like that appear here.

173
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,010
That's not really something that I do that often.

174
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,210
So basically, what I just showed you is pretty much now moving on to the sources panel.

175
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,910
This is a panel that you're in all the time also.

176
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,250
And the most common thing that you would do here is actually find the file that you're operating in

177
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,520
and then put a breakpoint in.

178
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,310
So if we go back to our scene.

179
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,030
We we know that we have this app, Jacir, so there's an app.

180
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,810
And so what you would do is he can actually find that file in the webcam, inspector.

181
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:29,140
So if you go here in the webcam inspector and you go to control P, this is like something that completely

182
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,900
blew my mind the first time that I found it.

183
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,020
So if you do abduct Jaycee, you can then find that file.

184
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,800
So you're going to see two things here.

185
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,900
The source map one and the regular one.

186
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,340
You're going to want to click on the source map one, because this is going to be the the react code,

187
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,870
basically.

188
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,990
So it's easy to read.

189
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,350
It's just like in your text editor, it's not like compiled code or anything.

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,970
And then you can put a breakpoint in here.

191
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,910
And this is pretty finicky.

192
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,640
I mean, it does stuff that you don't expect, like it puts breakpoints everywhere sometimes.

193
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,190
And that's, you know, not not great.

194
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,440
I mean, I think it's is actually putting multiple break points in here at certain times.

195
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,230
So if we if we just get rid of some of these or we can just leave those in and you can actually go over

196
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,200
here and if you want to, you can go on the side.

197
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,430
And then you could see sort of the the function stack, the call stack, you could see the breakpoints

198
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:18,580
here.

199
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,350
So it should show you where the breakpoints are.

200
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,990
So let me refresh this thing.

201
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,350
Maybe if I refresh it, I'll show you.

202
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,150
So if I refresh that app, then.

203
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,430
OK, those went away, so if I do this and then I go back, put that breakpoint there, I go back to

204
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,360
my code sandbox, if I just hit refresh on this here.

205
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,950
That should trigger that breakpoint, so that breakpoint is now hit.

206
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,810
So.

207
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,060
We're in the code sandbox again, and now I want to show you, if we go back to the console tab, if

208
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,310
you type in actually see the scope of where you are, so you see hello text.

209
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,090
And just like that, I'm typing out something here.

210
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,750
So now if you want to, you know, write some JavaScript around this, you want to split it by characters

211
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,160
or something like that, you could do that.

212
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,630
And just a good way to just see some JavaScript, what that does, that not variable.

213
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,460
Now, I'm here in this breakpoint.

214
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,300
I'm in this scope.

215
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,050
So you're only going to be able to see variables that are defined here.

216
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,930
So if I had a variable defined after this, I wouldn't be able to hover over it.

217
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,280
But with this yellow text, I can hover over it and see what it is so I could see it's equal to Hello

218
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,630
World.

219
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,260
So this is extremely useful.

220
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,210
This is basically how you debug things 90 percent of the time you're going to be doing this.

221
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,860
I don't really recommend going into the code base and putting the word debugger.

222
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,060
I used to do that.

223
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,680
I think, you know, you can write like the word debugger in here and that's going to do the same thing

224
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,720
if you really can't find the file.

225
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,910
This is what we would do before you could just go in the webcam specter and find the file before like

226
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,720
source maps.

227
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,460
You know, you had no idea where this code was running and you could not there was no chance of you

228
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,000
finding it.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,620
You would just put in a debugger like this.

230
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:05,000
But because you can easily find the file with the source maps, there's really it's just way easier

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,100
to just find this file rather than putting debugger statements in your code base, which you don't want

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,520
to even.

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,190
So anyway, we found the file and now we put a breakpoint there.

234
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,930
And what we're going to do now is, you know, you could step through, you could step over to the next

235
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,360
function call, you can step into it.

236
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,610
So if you're if you're about to run a function, you could do that.

237
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,130
You can, you know, step over.

238
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,350
You can continue the execution altogether.

239
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,660
You're no longer paused in the script.

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,660
Now, over here on the right, you could see we have the break point here.

241
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,690
You can right click over here and it doesn't show you.

242
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,060
Let me just get over here again.

243
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,560
So if I go over here and I right click it's going to show you you can actually you could remove the

244
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,040
breakpoint.

245
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,510
You could disable all break points.

246
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,970
So if you have a bunch of break points, you could just click remove all break points and there's dom

247
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,660
breakpoints.

248
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,080
There's a vent.

249
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,810
Listeners will get in all that later.

250
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,400
This is kind of high level overview of the usefulness of the sources tab.
