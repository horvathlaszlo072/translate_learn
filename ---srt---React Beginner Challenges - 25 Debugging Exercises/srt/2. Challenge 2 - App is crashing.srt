1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,180
All right, so this is challenge number two solution, and the remaining of these challenges are a lot

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,550
of these challenges are going to be involved with changing code around or fixing code that's broken.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,950
And you'll see the subjective up here, which is basically like, hey, this this is the issue and I

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,930
need you to fix this code by writing code in the sandbox.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,630
So basically the concept here is that you're getting some vague issue.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,740
So it's not going to be a specific thing you have to do because that would make it easy.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:28,980
Right?

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,670
Like if I told you exactly what you needed to do, it wouldn't be very it wouldn't be much of a challenge.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,270
So what this is doing is it's it's just giving you a simulation of somebody reporting an issue, which

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,560
is what you're going to encounter in the real world.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,400
So here you could say it just says the app is crashing.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,050
Fix the bug.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,310
So as you can see here, the syntax error should be pretty obvious.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,990
But if it isn't, then I'm going to show you how to debug this as if you had never seen this issue before.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,180
So as you can see here now, we can open the sandbox like this.

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,790
So if we click that open the sandbox button, it's going to be loading here and then we are in here.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,830
So this is just the the bigger sandbox, if you want to look at this.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,850
And as you can see here, we have the larger area.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,800
The area is more expanded.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,940
And if I go down here to the console, this would be the dev tools console here.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,340
Now, if I if I also just do control shift J, I will get the the real webcam inspector, which is what

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,450
you would see on a real app.

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,010
So I recommend just doing this.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
It's not going to be exactly as if you were on a real app.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,080
If you want to get the real app experience again, you could go up here and copy this you URL.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,270
So if we do that, we go over here.

27
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,110
Paste that in, we get this here, so and then now we could open up the dev tools in here and this would

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,460
be more like a realistic app, right?

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,950
We're not in a code sandbox anymore.

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,550
We're sort of running their actual app.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,470
So as you can see here, we are getting an error from Babille.

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,810
So you could see here we have this syntax error.

33
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,640
We trace it down into Babul.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,040
So you very you know, it's not your code, right?

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,130
This is definitely not what is our code, but the error is being raised from Babille.

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,310
So Babul is going to interpret your syntax and it's going to basically throw this error.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,940
Now, I'm not going to describe too much of this because if you don't know what this is, I don't want

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,600
to give it away.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,240
But basically, let's just say that we we don't know what this is and we're just going to Google this.

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,910
So if I just copy this or if I just write click and I say search Google for that error.

41
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,780
So as you can see, I get some stack overflow here as the first Google result.

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,620
And you could see this person asks this error and basically they get this on terminated Jass contents.

43
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,450
And as you could see, they have to unclosed div tags, so.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,370
So I'd get rid of those so and then try it again, so not really too much too helpful in this one,

45
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,150
but this person, I believe, shows what is wrong.

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,980
Give this closing, you know, backslash in the closing development and remove the semicolon.

47
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,680
So basically, he's just saying, hey, put put a closing div tag there.

48
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,880
As you could see here, we have a similar issue where we we are not closing the div tag and so it's

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,690
on terminated.

50
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:20,960
Right.

51
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,930
Terminating the div would be closing it off.

52
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,000
So we're just leaving something open ended.

53
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,190
And so that's the gist of this.

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,280
I know it was probably obvious for some of you, but if you if you weren't aware of this, this is a

55
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,300
syntax error.

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,550
And to just fix that errors, you could see all I'm doing is I'm just I'm just closing that div tag

57
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,850
off.

58
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,010
So I know this is probably an easy one, but I just wanted to include this in here as an example of

59
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,210
a syntax error.

60
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,000
So that is a challenge to now.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,770
Another thing you could do is you could.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,430
So let's go to our strategy guide here and how we debug that.

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,650
So again, we we read the error in the console and then we followed the stack trace that didn't really

64
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,440
help us that much because it was in an external library.

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,650
Right.

66
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,240
It was coming from Babul.

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,010
So we researched a little bit.

68
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,340
We did.

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,630
We Googled the error message and that was able to help us.

70
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,890
We found some some code, some comments that were able to help us find that bug.

71
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,600
Now, we could also try a clean example so we could try a clean react app.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,780
Right.

73
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:28,490
We could we could basically, again, like return an actual, you know, div that was it was closed.

74
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,330
And then we'll figure out will match that up with our code and we'll figure it out from there.

75
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,000
But yeah, that's another way of doing it.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
But again, this was pretty obvious one.

77
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,390
But if you had like a really complicated syntax error, you might want to backtrack and put some good

78
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,140
syntax in.

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,320
So that is the that's this one such challenge to.
