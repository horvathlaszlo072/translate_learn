1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,950
All right, so in this example, we have similar example to the first challenge, which is the guess,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,770
the password.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,490
So we're calling this get the password 2.0.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,030
So that's basically the same as the first challenge, which basically you have to use no code.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,200
So we're not writing code here.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,210
I didn't write that, but we're not writing code here.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,750
So all you have to do is basically try and guess the password using just your chrome dev tools, basically.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,930
So we're going to open up the sandbox in here and then we're going to go here to the new window, open

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,410
this up.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,630
And so now, just as you remember from the first one, we're going to just see what's going on.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,090
So if we try and enter in a password, you could see here we get an error that says invalid password.

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:54,020
So if we go and we look at that, we could see here it's happening in the app tags on submit.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,300
Right.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,630
So we're looking through we're saying, OK, well, this is happening here in this sandbox code where

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,640
where's our code react, Dom?

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,130
Developments, not really our code.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,140
So we go up one more and we see this is our app.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,240
So we click that.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,730
Now, you could see here we have that error happening in this submit function here for try catch.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,360
So if you're familiar with try catch blocks, you know that something went wrong here.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,910
If we're in this section of the code, right.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,360
And all this section does, it looks like it just sets an error, right.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,390
That says we have an invalid password.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,730
So that's how the error happens.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,230
We broke something here, actually, believe it or not, because we we failed.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,260
We threw an error in here and we actually ended up in here.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,390
Now, the first thing now now you could try and just look through this right now and see what's going

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,780
on there.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,550
But you could also set a breakpoint right here.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,950
So once we set a breakpoint there, we had submit.

31
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,800
Then we get and we hover over that.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,490
Usually that works, sometimes it doesn't.

33
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,200
So we hover over that can also just type that out in the console.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,450
And as you could see here, this is the actual error that the code is returning to us.

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,010
So what we did, we just said invalid password.

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,650
We're not going to tell you the client site error that happened in here, but what happened?

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,930
So some error happened here, ended up in here.

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,670
The default JavaScript is going to tell you what that error is.

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,080
And it's a it's this error cannot be set properly.

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,530
Zero of undefined.

41
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,440
Now, where is that happening?

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,890
Well, as you could see here, the submit function, of course.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,680
But then right in here, we could click on that.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,270
And that brings us to this line, we're actually stuck on this line currently, but if we go here again

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,940
and we could still click on that, we could see it highlights briefly right here.

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,410
So it looks like we saw.

47
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,360
So this is the the line that's actually causing the issue.

48
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,410
And most likely, this is what we need to focus on, because if we do this and we don't throw an error,

49
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,590
then we see we could set the wind condition.

50
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,590
So we have diagnosed the issue.

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,830
We've determined the root cause is in the cement function.

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,360
We are causing an error that's breaking and creating the invalid password.

53
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,060
So let's debug exactly what's going on here.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,820
Now, as you could see, we can't set property zero of undefined.

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,070
Now, if you remember, we did discuss this, right?

56
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,850
What does that mean?

57
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,780
It means that.

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:42,840
It can't set property zero of undefined, so undefined is what we need to look at, right?

59
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,970
What is undefined?

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,170
Ask yourself what is undefined here?

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, clearly friends is undefined.

62
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,990
If friends is defined on person, it would say so.

63
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,490
Friends is not defined on person.

64
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,550
It would say zero of undefined right because of friends was defined and it was an array then it would

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,840
not throw an error here.

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,220
Right.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,860
So if a person was undefined it would say, can I read property friends of Undefined.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,150
So how would we solve this.

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,430
Right.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,670
Well because we're in a loop.

71
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,140
We can't just put a breakpoint here.

72
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,350
Right.

73
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,640
Let's put a breakpoint in there.

74
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,210
We hit submit and you could see well, this friends is there.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,830
This friends is defined.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,450
Right.

77
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,880
So this is not where it's causing the issue.

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,960
So we hit Breakpoint again.

79
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,410
We see this this person also has friends, so.

80
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,500
What did what did we learn about conditional breakpoints?

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,180
Well, we learned that we can actually set a condition in here, so we edit this breakpoint and we say

82
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,360
no person friends.

83
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,910
So this means when this expression is true and when but that really means is when this is undefined.

84
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,090
Right.

85
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,520
Because if you invert or if you do this invert the undefined expression, you get true.

86
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,150
Right.

87
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,770
And we could confirm that by going in the console and you could say, look.

88
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,560
Like that we get true.

89
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:09,840
So that's just a little tip that you would be able to do here and say, OK, this so we want to put

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
a breakpoint here when this person has no friends.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,170
All right.

92
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,170
So we're going to set that conditional breakpoint and we're just going to hit refresh.

93
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:28,390
So now when we enter in a person, so we enter in a password, we get we get this and we get this error

94
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,110
here, right.

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
We've officially paused when the person's friends are undefined.

96
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,800
And so we see this.

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,380
We say, OK, this is the person's name.

98
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,740
So it's it's.

99
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:50,530
So this is the person that has no friends, we found the person that's causing the error, and now you

100
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,350
might be wondering, well, how do I modify this code to not go here?

101
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,740
Well, you could see here we have an exclude person function.

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,890
So if the so when we submit, we can exclude a person.

103
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,190
Right.

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,150
And the person's name that we exclude is equal to the input inside of the password.

105
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,920
So that's kind of the secret of this, is that we need to type in something that we want to exclude

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,920
from this friend's array.

107
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,800
Now, if you read any of this, this is all just a red herring, basically, to trick you into thinking

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,590
it had anything to do with mystery person.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,960
It doesn't.

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,600
This is just completely just nonsense that I added just to get this part of the code to break for a

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,310
certain person.

112
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,200
So mystery person is not what you needed to do here.

113
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,510
What you need to do is figure out which person has no friends, which is causing the error, which is

114
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,580
this person right here, which is if we go down her name is Pazzi MÃ©ndez.

115
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,020
So if I copy that.

116
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,370
Then let's get out of this break point.

117
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,170
If I copy that and I submit, I get the correct password.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,300
So that's this issue, what we learned here was conditional breakpoints, basic JavaScript errors,

119
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,210
try catch blocks and tracing the stack.

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,310
So I hope this was a good lesson for you.
