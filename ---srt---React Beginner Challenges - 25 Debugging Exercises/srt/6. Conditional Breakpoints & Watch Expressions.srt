1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,560
All right, hello.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,040
And this one I wanted to talk about conditional breakpoints and watch expression's, so I wanted to

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,270
talk about these together for a specific reason.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,720
I didn't want to just walk through what conditional breaks points are.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,880
I wanted to kind of give you an example of exactly when you would use them and why you would use them

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,850
just so you're not constantly using them without a reason.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,510
They're kind of a thing you use pretty rarely.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,790
I think that normally you kind of know where to put a breakpoint in your app.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,160
It's kind of obvious where the conditions are, right?

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,940
Like if I wanted to put a breakpoint on removed title, I'll just put a breakpoint here.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,350
Or if there's an if statement under a certain situation, I'll just put the breakpoint inside of the

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,920
IF statement.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,840
But in certain situations, for example, I added this new code here for looping over a long list.

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,210
Let's say you're looping over a group of people and you know that one of them is causing an issue.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,010
Where you would do is you put a conditional breakpoint in there and then that would break only under

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,210
those certain certain situations.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,890
So first, let's just go and just put a break point here just to show you just a normal breakpoint,

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,680
so.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,040
So this is just a normal breakpoint, as you can see, we have our variables up here and I'm going to

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,510
just hit continue now if we do so now, you could see this is going again.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,990
So what I'm going to do here is let's say we wanted to put a break point only when the remove or when

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,270
the no title boolean was set, which is only happens when we actually click on this remove title button

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,760
over here.

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,480
So when we click on this removed title button sets this no title to true.

25
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,240
So.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,950
If we go back over to our weapons inspector, what we're going to do is we're going to right click on

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,640
our break point and say edit breakpoint sort of click.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,780
We're going to say edit break point.

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,660
Now, in here, you could set a truthy expression so you don't have to just put something like equal

30
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,160
equals.

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,720
You can just put any expression that would evaluate to true.

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,160
So no title.

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,210
If I just write in the words no title, that would be a valid truthy expression.

34
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,540
So if I just put no title in there, my breakpoint turns yellow, which is an indication of it being

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,190
a conditional breakpoint.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,680
Just so you know that this is not going to happen.

37
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,120
It's not going to break every time.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,400
It's only going to break when that conditions there can.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,580
Right.

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,190
Click and disable it if you don't want it to appear ever.

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,650
But you can also remove it as well from the right click menu.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,240
So anyway, let's just go ahead and now click on that button.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,030
So if I go back here to my scene and I click on that button.

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,270
Now, you could see that breakpoint has been triggered and what happens here when we hover over the

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,400
no title is true.

46
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,940
So now we're in that state.

47
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,140
We could see what other variables are in the state and it's very useful for that certain situation now.

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,860
Like I said, this is kind of something you wouldn't really do too often.

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,820
Something you'd really want to do is when you're looping over a long list or something that you really

50
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,380
can't use a regular breakpoint for.

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,410
And so in this example, I'm going to put a breakpoint here, you know, going to.

52
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,560
Right.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,670
Click on that breakpoint.

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,520
And I'm going to just going to say I equals equals 40, so triple equals you're going to use that just

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,130
so it compares the the exact number is not going to be getting tripped up by a string, so.

56
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,660
I equals equals 40, it's only going to break during that loop when I is 40 and we're going to go and

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,540
we're going to now again refresh the page.

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:29,080
And so when we refresh the page, you can see that the eye is now 40, and if you go over here, you

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,460
could see this is the thread.

60
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,480
So we're just going to get rid of this.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,650
Now, the idea over here, this is a watch expression.

62
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,600
So if I get rid of this, you should have this.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,680
No watch expressions.

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,160
If you.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,550
Right.

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,700
Click on that, you'll see that there's a thing called ad watch expression.

67
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,350
So this is just an expression that you could watch for that condition.

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,010
So if you wanted to save a certain expression, which we're just going to put in the word ID because

69
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:00,610
we want to just see what our ideas I didn't mention this, but we are generating this idea for this

70
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:00,970
eye.

71
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,220
So we're just creating this new variable here just to show you that when we we've conditionally stopped

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,520
here at this point where when I is 40 and we've created this ID, which is this string.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,350
So just like that, we've we've put a conditional breakpoint in.

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,490
We've we've stopped our code at this point and now we can look at our watch expression and so forth.

75
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,300
So another so that that's great.

76
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,510
So if you wanted to put conditional breakpoints everywhere for a specific user ID or something that's

77
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,390
looping over a long thing, you could do that really easily with this.

78
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,430
And then you could watch a bunch of variables that you set to get like some nested attributes or something

79
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,820
out of there.

80
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,020
So that's very useful.

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,480
Now, what I'm going to show you here is actually another thing that you could see with watch expressions

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,490
is Chiasm continuing along.

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,600
It's showing me the watch expression for each one of those loops.

84
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,810
So that's really useful.

85
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,680
So that's pretty much all you're going to use conditional breakpoints for.

86
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,150
So thank you.
