1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,450
All right, so for this challenge, you could see here we have GitHub card repos are not showing any

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:06,900
data.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,010
Please see if you could fix.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:16,050
So you could see here we have this GitHub repos display here and we're going to go and open up the sandbox

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,190
to get a full view.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,340
OK, so as you can see here, this is a fairly involved example, we have a lot going on here in the

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,290
main app and then also we have some folders over here with an API components and some styles as well.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,220
So the issue.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,710
That we are experiencing is that the cards are not showing any data, so you can see here we have some

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,360
data, it looks like being shown.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,120
But at the end of the day, when we type something in, you could see here we are getting some cards

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,840
back basically.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,720
So when we do type this in, we really want to figure out first exactly what's going on.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:55,930
Right.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,440
We see we can experience the error here.

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,230
We could see that we don't have any names found here.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,610
And we see we have some mystery data on the bottom.

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,500
So first thing we really want to understand is what is actually going wrong here and the intention here.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,160
Now, I know it's kind of a complicated example, but the intention with this challenge specifically

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,270
was to understand why the names here were not being shown on the cards.

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:22,840
Right.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,750
And as well as this section here now you can see there is part of this data being shown here, but other

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,220
parts of the data are missing.

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,970
It doesn't look like any of this functionality is broken.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,290
It looks like this app works.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,810
It's just that there's data missing.

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,940
So let's continue on our investigation with identifying what components are actually causing this issue.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,260
Let's check our console.

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,450
Of course, as you can see, we are getting just some logs here, but no errors.

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,200
So what I want to do first, actually, is find the components that are actually being rendered in here,

31
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,160
so let's try to find that card first.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,320
So if I go to my react dev tools, it's probably better to open this in a separate tab.

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,790
So let's just go ahead and click open in new window over here.

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,040
And so now you can see we have the whole app open up.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,780
We're going to open up our dev tools.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,170
And when we open up our dev tools.

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,540
We can go to our react component, explore here, and we could just find these components here so you

38
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,370
can see we find the card and then we could go out and find specific things.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,350
So let's actually find the specific data point.

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,120
So here we go.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,290
We have No-Name found.

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,070
Here we go.

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,440
And then we can go over here to view source for this component.

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,740
So we were brought into this with stuff which isn't very helpful.

45
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,840
This doesn't tell us really what's going on.

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,090
This is a library inside of material.

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,510
Why?

48
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,770
So this is kind of a problem with these styled component wrappers.

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,880
They don't really give you the direct component and these debuggers.

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,830
So we're going to do is we're going to actually go up.

51
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,630
A little bit to find one that doesn't have this with Styles thing here, right?

52
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,390
So if we go up one more, then we find this one and we are actually brought into what looks like our

53
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,930
code, right?

54
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,800
Well, it's actually materialize code.

55
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,830
So this doesn't help us either because we want to debug our code.

56
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,110
Right.

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,830
So let's go one step above.

58
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,910
We have paper.

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,630
We have card.

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,680
Simple card.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,100
Let's go here, see if simple card can help us.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,860
So here we go.

63
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,920
Simple card is a function inside of card.

64
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,430
Jass cards is minified here.

65
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,520
So we're going to go and find the actual thing here with control or command post.

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,660
And then we're going to find for card games and then we're going to actually pick the source, mapped

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,620
one and then we're going to clean up.

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,260
We're going to close our other tabs.

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:01,250
So now we found the card contents, so now we could start to debug well, what's going on in here?

70
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,850
Well, you could see No-Name found is just written here and cannot find language is written here as

71
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,240
well.

72
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,920
So you could see these are just things that are written in the code, it looks like just in completed

73
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,150
project.

74
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,420
Right.

75
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,550
So let's actually put a breakpoint here.

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,270
So when I search for someone.

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,260
And I go in here, I can now just start to explore some data, right, so you could see what are the

78
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,030
actual props passed into this component?

79
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,830
You could go up and try and read some Propp types, Propp types are classes, but no other type, so

80
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,880
we don't know what else is in here.

81
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,840
So we have here this is looks like some styles classes.

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,100
Right?

83
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,350
So we don't really have much else to go off of.

84
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,540
Right.

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,010
We could go here and we could look at this, which is the description.

86
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,140
Right.

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,760
We know that some data is coming in, which is the description.

88
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,380
So we look at that and we could actually look and see.

89
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,840
We do have another actual prop here.

90
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,220
So this is actually just this is not what you think.

91
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,660
This is actually the classes.

92
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,350
This is just some, you know, nuances with the debugger here not being correct.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,800
Go over here.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,990
And this is the actual real props.

95
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,880
So we have another thing in here called repo.

96
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,920
So this looks like the the repo, which is what we're intending to fetch.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,100
Right.

98
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,160
Actually fetching GitHub repos by entering a username.

99
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,240
So it's important.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,580
I understand the business use case.

101
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,300
So we have that repo here.

102
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,890
And what we want to do here is actually find that missing data.

103
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
Now, that's actually the easiest way to do this.

104
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,300
What I really wanted to show at this demo actually was the network tab.

105
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,820
So let's say I didn't know what was going on in here at all and I wanted to debug some network data.

106
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,220
So if I go here and I search again, you could see we have.

107
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:53,910
Our requests, if you go on to this exchange and fetch request to filter here, you could see here that

108
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,410
we are getting a fetch to GitHub API and here you could click on this and you could see that.

109
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,740
This is where we can get the data preview, right, so we can actually see all the data coming back

110
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,450
and you can then look and see the different data parameters here, which is really cool.

111
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,290
So if you were able to do this, this is a really great thing to learn and to understand how to look

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,850
at the preview, the response preview and the raw response data as well.

113
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,890
So that's great.

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,990
If we go here and fetch again, we look I think we just spelled his name wrong.

115
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,540
And there was no this is one of the maintainers of react, so.

116
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,300
We refresh.

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Paige.

118
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:53,240
And once again, we go to repose, so at the end of the day, you have that previews here and what I

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,950
wanted you to understand was the name.

120
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,360
So where would the name be?

121
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,000
You could see there's a name object in this repo.

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,840
So let's go ahead and start filling in this data.

123
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,060
Right.

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,310
So we want to find the name.

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,790
We want to find the language.

126
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:11,210
So if we go back to our preview for that fetch, which is then, as you can see, we have the language

127
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,790
here as JavaScript and then also we're looking for stars or.

128
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,780
Or whatever this may be, it looks like shares or notifications or other data that we can look at,

129
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,830
so you could see here that this is really kind of a business issue, right.

130
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,050
Like you want to ask, well, what are the requirements for this component and look into that.

131
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,680
So clearly, the stars are here.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,530
Stargazers count to see the correct example.

133
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,890
You could just look at the fork that I have here of this issue.

134
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,460
And this is where we have the original code here.

135
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:56,830
And so if you go into the card here, you can see the original fix for this, which is to add in the

136
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,300
name language and stargazers count and then Fork's.

137
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,920
So the point of this message was to learn to clarify some business requirements, look into exactly

138
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,830
what the components are supposed to do, look at your network tab to inspect network data, to understand

139
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,760
different attributes using the react dev tools to actually find components that are in your code base

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,460
and not part of an external UI library, and then resolving the issue by just filling in the data so

141
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,650
we could fill in this data in our app as well.

142
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,990
But it will end up looking just like that.

143
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:42,370
So that's the only thing that was wrong with this, was that certain attributes here were not like this

144
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,390
right here.

145
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,320
So that's the only thing and thank you.
