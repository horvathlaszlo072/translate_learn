1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,590
All right, so four, challenge 22, you could see here we have when clicking on buttons, the theme

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,340
isn't set.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,790
So we click on this and we get an error here.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,350
So that's our first clue.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,860
If we go to open sandbox, you can see here we have this issue here and we could start to debug this

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,210
issue.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,750
So this issue is one that came up constantly in one of my courses.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,640
And I wanted to include this here because I feel like it's pretty important.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:35,540
And it happens because of, as you could see here, this is related to react context, and that's going

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,500
to be the topic of this specific challenge.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,260
So let's go ahead and start debugging this.

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,840
So when I click this, you see, I clearly get an error here and we're going to go ahead and open this

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,070
up into a new window like we always do, just to go ahead and look at the console.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,510
So you can see here, set theme is not a function on click.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,080
So I click this and as you could see here.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,940
We are inside of camp two, component two, so here we have two components that are being rendered,

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:13,000
one which shows the theme and then the other which shows this over here.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,990
So camp one is first up here, which is just as light.

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,500
And then the other component here shows the current theme and then the a series of buttons.

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,680
Now it says set theme is not defined.

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,970
Right.

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,860
So this is something.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,110
So you could see here, it's a set theme is not a function right on this line when I clicked the light

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,540
button.

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,490
So this is something that, like I said, happens constantly.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,640
And I think people are confused by this because they are unfamiliar with react context.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,270
So as you could see here, we have used context.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,130
So where is set theme supposed to be coming from?

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,330
It's supposed to be coming from this function called use context right here and here.

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,920
We have a theme context.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,990
So a theme context, as you could see here, was created up here with react, create context, dark.

32
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:16,590
So our question is, well, why isn't this returning what I want it to, which is these objects here?

33
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,280
So if we keep going, you could see here we actually use.

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,670
So now this is just an intro to context I'm going to go into now.

35
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,630
So basically you would need to research a little bit more about react, create context and use context.

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,280
So let's go ahead and research that now.

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,830
Now, I'm going to stick to use context because it's the most recent, you know, thing causing the

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,430
error here.

39
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,740
And I'm I just want to get refreshed on this specifically, which is looks like a react hook.

40
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,030
So let's go ahead and research that.

41
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:59,170
So if I say use context, it brings me to this Hooke's API reference where I click on Use Context and

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,020
you see here it accepts a context object and returns the current context value.

43
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,890
So the current context is determined by the value prop of the nearest provider.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,850
So you could see here that the current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest

45
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,730
provider.

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,350
So we'll first have to check if there's a provider.

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,570
Next, you'll see it will trigger a referendum with the latest context value passed in to the provider.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,670
So as you could see here, it's correct to pass in the context in there.

49
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,050
So we pass that incorrectly, it seemed.

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,590
And we are then.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,200
So here we go.

52
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,040
As you can see here, this looks very familiar to our example.

53
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,800
But as you can see here, we create a context.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,950
And then we use that context here to get the theme and then we access properties off of that theme,

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,730
we say themed background themed foreground.

56
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,610
So you could see the object that we pass in here, the object that we get out of this is an object and

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,220
that we can access properties off of that.

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,130
So how do we get this passed in the app?

59
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,850
Well, through the value proper member of the nearest provider.

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,950
So the value prop passes in this theme object here, which is dark.

61
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:27,330
So we pass in this and then we could get the properties out of that easily by just accessing them.

62
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,780
All right.

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,770
So this is a documentation for use context.

64
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,400
Let's go back and check on our example so you could see we have the theme provider here.

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,010
And as you could see, we have a value object here.

66
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,550
As you know, as we just learned, the value is was returned here.

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,760
And it looks like we are getting the theme and then the set theme here.

68
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:48,970
So.

69
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,720
As you can see, what we have passed into value is just the theme, so all we have to do is then add

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,930
in a set, a set theme function.

71
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,600
Now, where do we do that?

72
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,330
Well, we have a react hook right here.

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,630
Right.

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,590
So if we add in theme and then set theme.

75
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,930
We could then pass in set theme here to the value prop of the provider, and then now if we click,

76
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,440
you could see we don't get the error anymore and we are correctly switching state, which goes into

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,630
the context provider and then gets structured here off of the value.

78
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,790
So this is a better example of how to use react context to create a dark and light theme.
