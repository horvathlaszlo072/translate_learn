00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,320
In this video, we are typing out our user redux files as usual.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,840
To begin, we will start in types file and we will convert it over to X file.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,590
We will switch this const over to an enum.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,030
And again, we get rid of the equal sign and we convert all these colons to equals.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,110
The thing that we've done before was that every time we were storing some kind of data structure inside

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,170
of our state, particularly if we're current user, we would put the user type or the object type,

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,330
the data type inside of our user types file or the corresponding types file.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,150
In this particular case, our user data actually lives inside of our Firebase Utils.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,800
If you remember earlier, we had defined this user data property.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,050
So here what we can do is we can either keep it related to Firebase or move it to user types.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,970
Personally, I'd rather keep it in the user data inside of Firebase because this data actually matches

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,700
the data inside of Firebase that we get back.

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,090
So to me, it's more correspondent that it's related to Firebase than it is related to some type that

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,850
we have defined specifically for Redux.

16
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,560
So here what we're going to do then is we'll leverage it inside of the actual Firebase file.

17
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:37,030
And now what we're going to do is we are going to begin the process of migrating our user action into

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,260
our matcher pattern.

19
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,680
So first off, let's bring in our with matcher.

20
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,680
And what we need to do is essentially also bring in that user data.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,070
So user data like so.

22
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,540
And now that we have our imports, all we can do is convert this action over to a dots file.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,380
And then we can start defining the actual action types.

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,570
So we have all of our action creators, but we need to create a bunch of different action types because

25
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,030
essentially when you think about each of these, which ones create new actions, which one create all

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,800
the actions while looking at them, they seem to all create new actions.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,600
So that means that we have to define a new action type for each of them.

28
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,760
So let's start first.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,950
We want to make our check user session, which is going to be this one.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,690
So let's move this up here.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,040
And here this is equal to action and action payload, which we also forgot to import.

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,380
So we also need our action with payload.

33
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:56,120
Now check user section just takes action and then this user action types of check.

34
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,120
User session like so.

35
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,490
So here we can.

36
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,310
Do that and make sure that this action returns the appropriate action type that we've just defined.

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,670
And also wrap this with a with matter.

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,860
Now.

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,630
Similarly, we need to do this for every next one of these actions.

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,210
So I want you to try this out.

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,930
What I'm going to do is quickly speed through it so that you can see, because a lot of this is just

42
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,910
doing the same thing we've done over and over again.

43
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,660
And I don't really want to bore you too much with me typing all of these different methods.

44
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,010
So I'll do a few.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,420
I want you to then pause the video, do a few, and then we can accelerate through this quickly and

46
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,740
get to the final state.

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,400
So let's continue with a check user session.

48
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:52,290
Let's do set current user so that we can do one with a payload, which is two action with payload.

49
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,270
And this one will take.

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,600
This user action types with set current user.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,040
And of course it's going to be of the type user data.

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:16,310
Continuing on, we want to actually pass this like so and wrap this inside of a with my sure.

53
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,330
Then we want to do our Google sign in.

54
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,860
Start.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,640
Which is equal to an action of the type.

56
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,890
User Action Types.

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,130
Google Sign and start.

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,410
Which we will then, of course, similarly assign and also wrap in a with matcher.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,440
And then we go, we've done three actions.

60
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,250
So now all the subsequent ones, very simple here.

61
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,880
The only one that might be new is that additional details.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,970
We need to also bring in additional details or whatever we called it in our particular case, additional

63
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,660
information.

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,440
We can set that not even here.

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,610
We can just set that inside of the actual action type.

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,040
So here you can see that we actually wrap this inside of an object just like this one.

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
So you know what?

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,660
I'm going to do these three unique ones email, sign and start.

69
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,370
Sign up, start and sign up.

70
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,860
Success where our payload is unique.

71
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,550
So here we don't even have to be too explicit about it.

72
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,470
We can make one.

73
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,700
Let's call it email sign in start, which is equal to a action with payload.

74
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,320
And here we can do user action types dot.

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,090
Email.

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,950
Sign and start.

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,990
And we can literally just pass a brand new type here where email goes.

78
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,500
The string.

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Password goes to string.

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,810
We don't even have to make a new type for it necessarily.

81
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,670
We can if we plan to re-use this actual email site and start payload.

82
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,960
But in our particular case, we don't need it more than just being here.

83
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,580
So I'm just going to hardcoded as we saw right inside of the type definition.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,290
We can do the exact same thing here for sign up start, which I'm going to do before everything else.

85
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,350
Actually, for that current user, I did not set this to a user data type.

86
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,350
So let's just quickly do that.

87
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:35,470
But now for the sign up start let's say export type sign up start is equal to and.

88
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,060
Action with payload.

89
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,420
And here it is, a user action type sign up start.

90
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,070
We take an email, which is a string, we take a password which is a string, and we take a display

91
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,300
name, which is a string.

92
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,610
And now here we just a string.

93
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,580
Sign up.

94
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,010
Start.

95
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,070
Similarly wrap this in a with matter like so.

96
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,370
And here we see we actually have a type error.

97
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,330
What's our type?

98
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,780
Our email string parser string explaining string is not assignable to sign up start properties are incompatible

99
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,550
user action type cytosol is not assignable to user action type sign out start.

100
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,530
So here this is sign up start.

101
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,900
We see that what we had was sign out.

102
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,600
Start for that is a typo.

103
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,010
And again, you see how TypeScript will tell you when you make this mistake.

104
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,450
So really great.

105
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,470
So now these remaining ones all should be quite simple.

106
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,970
You've seen me do pretty much all of them.

107
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,230
I want you to do it.

108
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,990
I'm just going to speed through the section.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,980
I'm going to accelerate the video so you can just reach the end and watch me doing all these ones.

110
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,640
Welcome back.

111
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,250
So there we go.

112
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:14,540
I have just coated out all of these different action types and attach them to the corresponding action

113
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,890
creator as well as wrapping them in the corresponding with matcher.

114
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,330
So all very straightforward, just very tedious and very numerous.

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,230
But now that we have them, try and use them inside of the reducer, really think about what it is that

116
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:38,120
our user reducer is going to need in order for us to actually switch it over to utilize these action

117
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,620
creator match patterns.

118
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,610
Because you see, there's a couple of followers here, so try it out yourself.

119
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,770
Join me in the next video or we'll do it together.

120
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,180
I'll see you in the next video.
