1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:08,330
Let's get started with React BASIX now, if you've taken any of my previous courses where Aftar react

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,430
or you're not a react beginner and you've built some applications before with react, then you can actually

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,820
just skim through these videos or skip this entire section as this section covers their react basis.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,090
We're going to build our first react application from scratch using something called create react up.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,550
And then we're going to deploy to GitHub pages.

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,390
Again, if you're completely new to react, then you have to finish this section to move on with the

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:38,760
course.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,250
However, for those with a bit of experience, you might find the section a little bit easy.

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,420
Determine for yourself which direction you want to go.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,560
Remember, our goal here is to build these basics so that we can build our giant application, our e-commerce

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,950
platform, using react now in this section, we're going to learn a few things.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,150
However, we're going to make a few assumptions here.

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,500
First, we're going to assume, you know how to use your terminal or your command prompt.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:18,040
And you can also use any code editor you want, you can use visual studio code, sublime text or any

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,620
other popular JavaScript developer environments.

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,040
Now, this section is going to be a code along, so I highly recommend, if you're following along,

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,330
to have your terminal or command prompt set up, if you're on Windows Terminal, if you're on Mac or

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,360
Linux system and have your code editor.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,700
So you follow along.

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,850
Now, over the next couple of videos, we're going to install node if you don't have it already, and

21
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,060
also the Create React app that is going to allow us to.

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,450
Right.

23
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:49,910
React.

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,670
I do want to make a few notes, though.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,150
First.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,220
Would this course, as long as you have a version 10 or higher four note, you're going to be fine.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:10,180
If you don't have a version of note on your system that is 10 or lower, then I recommend updating note

28
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,950
or if not, you can use something called and VM and SVM is a node version manager.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,820
So it's a simple way in the terminal for us to switch node versions.

30
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,750
Now, this is something you can go through on your own.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,540
The easiest way to do things is to just simply download Noad from the Node Jamesburg website.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,630
Now, the second thing we're going to do is we're going to actually install something called create

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,590
reactor and if I go to Reactor or here and I go to Dock's.

34
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:53,520
Under the create a new reactor up, we have this thing called create reactor, which we're going to

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,170
talk about in the upcoming video.

36
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:03,180
Now, the one thing I want to mention is that you'll see this command, NPR and NPR is actually new

37
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,780
and comes with version of NPM five point two.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,340
So if your AMPM version is lower than this, this command won't work.

39
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,100
So you might want to update your NPM version as well.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,470
Now and for those that haven't seen it before, runs a command of a package without installing it explicitly.

41
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,060
So what does that mean?

42
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,610
Well, before we had NPCs, this is what we had to do.

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,410
You see here that this is the current version of REACT based on when you're watching the video, you

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,390
might have versions that are higher.

45
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,500
But again, this course will work with any versions higher than sixteen point eight.

46
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,190
If I go here and go to an older version of react, let's say fifteen point six, if I click on documentation

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,560
and then let's do docs, and then finally we look at the installation.

48
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,880
You'll see that we had to run NPM, install globally, create a reactor, and then we ran the Korea

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,840
reactor up command to create our app and allows us to not install this global version of a reactor and

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
just simply run that one comment to create our app.

51
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,100
All right.

52
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,180
Now, let's go back.

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:30,660
If for some reason during this section you are unable to get this started, there is another option

54
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,450
where you can use this code sandbox daddio, which I'll link to that actually allows you within the

55
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,720
browser to use react online.

56
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,640
Now, one last thing, we're going to get started and go step by step into building our reactor application,

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,040
but I also want to point something out to you.

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,770
You see, when we study or learn libraries or frameworks or tools like react, the best place to learn

59
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,410
about something is often the documentation.

60
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,850
And most tutorials don't mention this fact that, well, we have the official reac documentation that

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,480
explains how we react works inside and out.

62
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,440
Most materials that you see online are taught using this basic template.

63
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,980
So remember, if you ever have questions, this is always the best place to start.

64
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,830
Now we're going to be covering some main concepts and react here, but remember that the way you learn

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,070
a library is not like reading a dictionary where you just learn every single thing that this library

66
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,520
gives you.

67
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,690
The thing to understand that will go into later on in this course is how to build bigger and bigger

68
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:50,680
applications, how to architect your app so that instead of learning something like a dictionary, one

69
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,340
by one, we learn the principles and the concepts that allow us to do advanced things and build real

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,740
life applications, something that I'm really excited to do in this course.

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
So enough talk.

72
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,090
It's time for us to get started.

73
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,510
We're going to start setting up our environment in the next video.

74
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,720
We're going to build our first app and it's going to be a fun one.

75
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,760
I'll see that one by.
