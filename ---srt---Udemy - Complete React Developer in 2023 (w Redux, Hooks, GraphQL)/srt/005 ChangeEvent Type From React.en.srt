00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,490
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,850
In the last video we learned about the change event handler and the receiving of input elements as an

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,460
argument for what this function defines.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,220
Now this function by default, returns void, which is what change event handler assumes you're going

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,580
to do.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,750
You don't need to return anything because it's not expecting you to receive anything.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:28,670
But if for some reason you wanted on your change handler to actually register some type of return for

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,390
whatever reason.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,890
Another way that you can actually define this function is you can bring in the change event.

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,610
Change event is the event definition instead of the actual function definition.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,350
And what this means is that you can define your own function definition.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:57,350
So you can say, I'm going to give you some function where I expect to receive the event of change event

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,150
where the change event is registered to H HTML input element.

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,080
If you remember earlier when we looked at the actual change event handler, when we hovered over the

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,780
parameter, we noticed that we were receiving the change event as well, where we were passing the actual

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,170
type.

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,980
So before we do that and take a look at that, I'm just also going to now explicitly return void because

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,880
that's what this function does.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,970
If you want to return something else though, again, you could put something here like your boolean

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,520
or your string or whatever this change event you happen to return.

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,470
For whatever reason, this is just another way that you can define this.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,530
But going back to this change event, I also want to bring in this change event handler.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,680
And I just want to show this side by side so we really understand what's happening here.

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,660
So when I hover or change event handler again, we receive some generic T which is equal to an element

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,990
and then that gets passed to change event.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,550
So essentially this is change event.

27
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,290
Change event here is expecting some value t in order for us to tell it what type of element this change

28
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,890
event is for.

29
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,220
So really this function that we see right here is really just us typing it out like so.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,540
More manually.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,920
That's really just something I wanted to highlight to you if you wanted to define your own function

32
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,450
normally.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,330
If you look at this actual definition and you see that there's a change event that is being defined

34
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:38,560
in the actual function type definition, you can use that very easily as well and write your own function

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,460
definition so you get more granular control, such as if you wanted to pass back or return some specific

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,060
type or if you wanted to even add additional parameters for some reason.

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,740
Again, this main idea is that oftentimes when it comes to typing with third party libraries, you really

38
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,880
just got to read the types.

39
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,880
It gives you a better idea of what the functions do, but it also gives you more granular control with

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,930
your typing as well.

41
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,200
And this becomes especially important as we start interacting with more and more third party libraries.

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,480
So that's it.

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,700
I just want to highlight to you that there are numerous ways that you can type out.

44
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,430
These third party interactive parameters that you're passing.

45
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,500
So here, let's just use the change event so that we can be more explicit in what we see.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,810
So with that, let's type the rest of our project.
