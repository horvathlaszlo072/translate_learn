00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:09,850
This advice works not just with react, but in programming in general, and right here I say trim the

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,260
fat.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:18,100
But what I really mean is that breaking down things into small, simple units is a good way of programming.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,690
You have a giant component with a lot of good.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,410
Then most likely why you want to do is break that into smaller components.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,250
Sure, it might be more JavaScript files, you might say, oh, that's going to get a little too messy.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,470
Too many JavaScript files.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,940
Well, then I argue that perhaps you should organize your files in a better system.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,970
Because although, yeah, we might have more JavaScript files will have more components, what we do

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:53,260
by breaking things down is that we make things easier to test, easier to understand and less likely

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,160
to break.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,580
Right.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,480
If things are just small units that just concern themselves with one specific thing they're less likely

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,980
to break.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,740
They're also easier for people to understand.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,720
They open up a file and you have 30 lines of code.

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,880
That's easy to read than a giant component that you have to go line by line to figure out what's happening.

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,930
So ninety nine percent of the time, if you think that component can be broken down into smaller components,

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,210
yeah, go ahead and do it.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,380
Although it just may generate more files.

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:34,030
A code in the end, as projects get larger and larger, the idea of having reusable components becomes

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,470
more and more important.

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,690
So trim the fat people.
