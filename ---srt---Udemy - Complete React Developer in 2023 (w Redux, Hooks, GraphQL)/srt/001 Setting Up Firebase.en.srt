00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,090
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:10,280
In this video, we are going to start building out some of our reliance on the front end with some kind

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,180
of database.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,570
So in this course, I'm not actually going to build a database from scratch.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,570
We're going to leverage a great existing tool made by Google called Firebase.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,050
And what Firebase is going to help us do is we are going to be able to build out our sign in page using

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:34,070
authentication so that we can store the users and refer to those users and sign in those users whenever

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,350
anyone wants to access our application.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,080
Luckily for us with Firebase, we can also leverage sign in with Google, which is Google sign, in

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,440
which we'll talk about after we learn about Firebase first.

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,900
So what is Firebase?

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,750
Firebase is a Google platform that allows you to spin up a database.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,180
It actually is a pretty comprehensive suite of hosting tools and different things for your website.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,480
But the primary usage is that it helps us leverage some kind of database.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,530
That's the most important thing so that we do not have to set our own up.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,670
So what I want you to do is I want you to go to Firebase Dot Google.com or click the Firebase Link inside

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,870
of your resources folder.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,150
Once you're inside a firebase, I want you to click Go to console up in the right corner.

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,770
What this will do is this will take you to the list of all of your existing Firebase projects.

20
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,520
I already have one because we've had this application course now out for almost two and a half years

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,660
by the time of this recording.

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,700
So what you're going to do, though, is let's make a brand new one.

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
I'll make a new one with you.

24
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,210
I want you to click this ad project and here I want you to name your project whatever you want.

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,500
I'm just going to name my crown clothing DB.

26
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,350
So here this will be my project name.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,210
But down here, you'll notice that there's this unique identifier for your project.

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,500
So this pretty much just allows Firebase to say that once you instantiate up your instance of Firebase,

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,820
this is your Firebase platform's unique ID.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,160
So whatever it generates, you can just keep it or you can name it something else if you want.

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,320
But here I'm just going to say Crown Clothing DB and then I'm going to hit continue.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,520
Next up, they're going to ask if you want Google Analytics.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,780
I don't want Google Analytics because this actually makes it a little bit more complicated.

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,400
I also don't have a Google Analytics account that I want to tie to this project, but you can do so

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,710
if you want to with your firebase.

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,300
But honestly, for the purpose of this project and for this course, we're not going to touch it.

37
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,030
So from here, we just create the project.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,880
And now let's just wait for our project to finish building.

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,010
OK, so our new project is ready.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,030
And what you're going to do is going to continue, this will now take you into your actual clown clothing

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,360
database or whatever you named your Firebase instance.

42
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,830
And there's two main things that I want you to focus on inside of your project.

43
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,990
One is authentication and one is these two database options.

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,920
We are going to use Fyre Store Database because this is the newest instance.

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,570
Real time database is their old database, so don't worry about that.

46
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,230
Just ignore it.

47
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,750
We're not going to use as much storage or hosting.

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,610
We might use some functions, but that'll be later.

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,830
We won't use machine learning.

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,530
These are all just a different suite of tools that comes with Firebase.

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,720
But we really just want to leverage buy our store database and the authentication.

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,450
So we have this instance now set up, but before we start using it, there's a couple things we need

53
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:46,870
to do.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,580
We need to actually allow our reactor application to leverage Firebase and Firestar and authentication.

55
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,690
And to do that, we need to install the Firebase library.

56
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,630
So in order to install Firebase, let's go back to our terminal inside our project.

57
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,450
We are going to type yard.

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,340
Add Firebase now at the time of this recording.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,650
The version of Firebase that is going to install is nine point six point six.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,250
Google does like to change up Firebase every once in a while, but generally speaking, they're always

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,790
backwards compatible, meaning that whatever you learn here is also going to be largely compatible in

62
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,750
the newer versions.

63
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,900
Maybe the UI that you've seen changes, or maybe the docs change a little bit, but largely speaking,

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,110
the high level concepts of Firebase is all going to be the exact same.

65
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,940
And it's really important that I teach you these high level concepts.

66
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,670
It's also important that you learn these high level concepts because unfortunately, especially in React

67
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,330
and with the front end world, things constantly change.

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,650
Libraries change.

69
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,280
A couple of years is a lifetime inside of the frontend world, so you need to really be able to understand

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,560
these high level concepts so that when the libraries change, you still largely know what's going to

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:05,950
happen.

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,170
You might just update the syntax a little bit.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,810
Follow some new patterns and conventions that they believe will leverage and give you greater capability.

74
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,190
But generally speaking, the most important thing to understand is these high level concepts.

75
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,970
So now that we have Firebase installed, what we're going to do is we're just going to go into our application

76
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,180
and just set up a quick route for sign it.

77
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,350
So inside of routes, I'm going to make a new folder called Sign In and inside of this folder.

78
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,190
Let's make a new file called sine and dark component Dutch assets.

79
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,920
And this is just going to be a very simple component.

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,390
So I'm going to call it sign-In.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,700
It's a functional component that just returns a div and inside the div is just an H1 that says sign

82
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,360
in page just so that we know that our routing is working.

83
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,300
Remember, it's always important that in order to minimize your errors, just code a bit at a time.

84
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,800
Start with what you know.

85
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,980
Make sure it validates and works and then continue.

86
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,580
So here, let's duplicate our route path and the path should go to sign in.

87
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,360
And the element that we want to render is going to be our silent component.

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:28,840
So here I'm just going to say part sign in from roots, sign in sign in component.

89
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,700
And then instead of rendering shop, I want to render sign in.

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:42,150
So this, of course, is nested inside of our root level route, so it will be slash sign it as we know,

91
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,900
just like we saw with home and just like we see with shop.

92
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,710
And once we have our sign in, what we also need to add is a way to get there.

93
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,290
So inside of your navigation component, I want you to duplicate this second link and inside say that

94
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,120
it goes to sign in.

95
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,680
Actually, let's use the dash, I kind of like the syntax a little better.

96
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,680
So let's go back to our OPG's and switch this route to sign in like this.

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,060
And then let's make sure that we say that it's a sign in link.

98
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,490
And now let's verify this works.

99
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,690
So we've added a link that takes us to sign in, and we also included a route that points to the path,

100
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,880
sign in and renders our sign and elements.

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,860
So we're just rehashing everything we've done so far and learn so far about navigating and react on.

102
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,350
So let's go back to our application or our browser, and we see that we now have a sign in button inside

103
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,400
of our navy link.

104
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,090
If we click it, we see that we're also rendering our sign in page.

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
So everything is working as we expect.

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,570
sign-In is working.

107
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,680
And now what we need to do is actually bring in Firebase, the library that we downloaded into our application

108
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,960
and write some code to leverage this library.

109
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:05,010
But primarily leverages libraries so we can actually access this instance that we have of Firebase that

110
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,090
we've also set up.

111
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,220
So in the next video, I'm going to talk about how we do that and also get a better understanding of

112
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,380
a lot of these external tools and how these libraries that we're using actually connect with them and

113
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,080
understanding the better practices on the frontend web.

114
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,370
I'll see you in the next video.
