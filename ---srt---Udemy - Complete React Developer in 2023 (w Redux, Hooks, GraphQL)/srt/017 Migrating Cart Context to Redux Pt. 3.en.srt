1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,230
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,110
In this video, we're going to migrate over all of these different references to context inside of our

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,990
components that we found over so that we can now use the bindings in Redux because we've migrated the

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,650
cart over.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,030
There's actually a strategy you can use to approach which of these to change first based on which components

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,550
are able to have references that will open it up for us to we can access further ones.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,970
An example for this is that we know that everything now that references car context is no longer working

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,950
because we've removed the car provider that we had before from our index.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,410
Yes.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,920
So the first thing that we should probably hook up is any places that have the most high level access

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
that will then unveil for us the remainder of the code.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,300
For example, we can't really see the CART dropdown unless we can open the cart dropdown.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,000
So what this means is that inside of our navigation, we probably want to do this first so that we can

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,910
actually set is open or is not open.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,600
So to begin, let's get rid of any references to use context as well as the car context.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,330
And then what we'll do is we will import in what we need from our appropriate store folder so we know

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,620
we need is cart open.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
This is going to be a selector that we have inside of our cart selectors.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,950
So let's go up into the appropriate file for cart selector and here we'll say select is cart.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,600
Open.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,140
We also need use selector, which we already have when we did our current user.

22
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,940
So here I'm going to say is car open is equal to use selector.

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,460
Passing in select is cart open.

24
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,690
Now let's save our code.

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,550
And what we know now is that we can see the cart drop down as long as his car open is true or false.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,710
So the binding there works.

27
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,930
But the next thing we need to do is actually make it so that we can set that value is car open.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,430
So to do that, more have to do is go into our car icon and we'll have to remove our reference to car

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,980
context, use context and import in our dispatch.

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,390
So here we know we have his card open as well as reading his car open and cart count.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,750
So that means we also will need use selector because we have to select off the car count value and is

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,260
car open.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,330
What we need now next is we have to impart in the appropriate selectors as well as action traders.

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,900
So let's first go up to the appropriate folder.

35
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,220
Of store.

36
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,940
And then carte.

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,980
And then we need one for our card selector and we need one for our cards.

38
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,830
Actions.

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,440
So let's think about which ones we need here.

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,250
We need cart count.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,230
So let's get select cart count.

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,740
And also we need select is cart open.

43
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,190
As for our action creators, we just need our set is carte open.

44
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,570
And here.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,580
Now, we don't need this anymore.

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,200
We can just make sure that we get, first off, the cart count value, which is equal to use selector

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,690
passing in select cart count.

48
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,980
And then we also need our dispatch, because we will be dispatching our action creators.

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,020
And we can now say, hey, this toggle method right here that we already have.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,690
What it will do is it will say set is open is a.

51
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,320
Action creator.

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,420
So we know we have to dispatch this.

53
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,540
So let's just wrap this inside of our dispatch.

54
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:10,970
As for is car open we can get this value using our selector for select is car open.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,960
And there we go.

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,490
That's all we need.

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,010
So now what we should be able to do is at least open and close the cart dropdown.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,290
So if we go back to our application.

59
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,970
We see, that's exactly what we get.

60
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,040
Next step, we need to set up our cart dropdown so that it can actually show the values.

61
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,780
So inside of our card drop down component, I'm going to get rid of cart context again as well as use

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,380
context.

63
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,690
And here we see that we just need cart items.

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,670
So I'm going to import in use selector from React Redux.

65
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,390
And then as far as the actual selector goes, I need to select cart items.

66
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,970
From the card selector.

67
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,170
And here I'm just going to say, I get my car items.

68
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,720
From U selector passing in.

69
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
Select card items.

70
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,370
But in order for us to actually get car items into this car dropdown, we need to make sure our product

71
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,180
card is able to actually dispatch the add items cart.

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,050
So here once again, let's get rid of our cart contexts.

73
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,190
And what we know we need is pretty much just the add item to cart action.

74
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,840
So I'm going to import in use dispatch because as we know, every single one of our actions needs to

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,560
be dispatched.

76
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,170
And then I'm going to import in our add item to cart method.

77
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,980
Which comes from the appropriate folder inside of our store once again.

78
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,970
So let's go to store cart.

79
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,970
Action.

80
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,100
And let's just make sure that this is the right method.

81
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,440
So here I'm going to go into this file.

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,650
And down here we see that it is at items a cart.

83
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,640
So this is indeed the correct name.

84
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,890
And then all I need to do.

85
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,890
Is get rid of this context.

86
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,930
Bring in dispatch using the used dispatch hook and then just making sure that we dispatch out our action

87
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,540
creator that had the same name as our old function.

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,240
So now I should be able to do is add items.

89
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,140
But here we see items that find is not a function.

90
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,570
So something we've done is a little off.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,470
Let's go back and check.

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:50,130
Inside of here we call add item to cart and as we notice, we need to pass and cart items into our actual

93
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,850
action creator.

94
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,520
So we were not doing that, but we knew that we had to do this when we set up the actual action creator.

95
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,000
So in order to get this value, what we'll have to do is get in the car items that is currently inside

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,750
of a retail store.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,330
So we'll need to bring in use selector and also import in.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,660
The appropriate car item selector.

99
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,580
Select cart items like soap.

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,030
And now I can just say contact cart items is equal to use selector.

101
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,610
Calling select card items.

102
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,710
And then I'll just pass cart items into add item to cart like so because the first argument is the current

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,320
card items.

104
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,060
This is the one that we need to add.

105
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,040
And now if I go back to the application and let's refresh.

106
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,110
There we see we got the appropriate actions firing and here we see that we are indeed getting our correct

107
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,620
values.

108
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,460
So at this point now we've migrated everything we need inside of the main application except for the

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,900
actual checkout components.

110
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,250
So you've seen me do it.

111
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,500
If you haven't done it, try it out yourself.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,460
If any of this seems confusing, again, we practice and implement it and got it out and then move it

113
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,140
over again, as I mentioned.

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,450
You want to think about the migration strategy.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,270
You want to pick the components that you need to unlock through the first surface level of the migration.

116
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,000
And then as you go deeper, you're able to actually access those and modify them as well.

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,100
So fix up the checkout and then join me in the next video where we'll do it together.
