1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,870
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:09,070
So let's now move the remainder of what we had inside of our objects into its own component.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,830
Inside of the components folder.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,130
When we think about what we want to name this, you want to kind of pick a name that really captures

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,650
what this feature will be for us because this feature is not being reused yet.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,680
We don't need to overly optimize what the definition of this component really is right now.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,370
We know at least it's our directory menu.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,740
So I'm just going to call it directory and inside, I'm going to call it directory component dot GSX.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,360
And I'm just going to move over.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:57,080
This code, some of the say Konst directory is equal to a functional component that returns back.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,740
This to.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,120
We know that off the props, we're going to get categories.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,770
And then we also know that we're going to export default.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,420
We see that we're missing category item.

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,370
So let's go to Angus.

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,720
And let's scroll up and take this category item.

17
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,330
Because we no longer need it in objects anymore, since we're now putting it up into directory.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,790
So here we just need to make sure that our relative import is correct.

19
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,760
So from here we go up one.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,960
And right now we go from directory up to the components folder and then into category item and the remainder

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,560
stays the same.

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,690
So here is our directory.

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,410
Now what we also need is the styling for this directory, because if you remember, we have a bit of

24
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,690
styling in our categories that sees us.

25
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,180
So let's make a new file called Directory Dot Styles Dot SAS.

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,190
And inside, let's just copy over our categories container.

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,790
You can call this categories as well just to match the styling.

28
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,890
For me, I'm going to make this a little bit more clear.

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm going to say directory container.

30
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,550
And I'm going to modify the styling inside of directory component here, this class name, so that it's

31
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,390
more clear as well.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,780
You can easily make these changes on the fly.

33
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,220
As you write your code, honestly, sometimes you might feel like you're naming of a component makes

34
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,560
more sense as you start writing it out.

35
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,780
It's perfectly fine to change these class names and all this stuff when you're in this phase where you're

36
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,770
building out a feature.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,270
As you start to work with other teams, sometimes you may want to talk about this with your teammates

38
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,940
to make sure that everyone understands and agrees that these component names do capture what it is that

39
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,450
you're writing.

40
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,630
Because one key thing to think about when it comes to variable names, you are writing code for people.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,390
Yes, the computer interprets it, but it's developers human people that are reading this code.

42
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,760
So you need to be writing these function names and these component names in a way that is intuitive

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,270
for people.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,480
What's intuitive for some may not be intuitive for others.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,280
So feel free to rename this whatever you want as well, whatever makes sense to you about what we're

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,710
building.

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,560
You can definitely try and name it that way.

48
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,880
That's the beautiful thing.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,070
I want you to try and see.

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,240
That's honestly sometimes the best way for you to know whether or not something makes sense or not.

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,920
So let's go back to our OPG's, and now let's import in our directory.

52
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,180
So when you go up to our components into our directory folder, grab directory component file and we'll

53
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,010
just replace this whole section here.

54
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,410
With our directory and we're going to pass in categories is equal.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,590
Two categories.

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,030
And now let's save this code.

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Let's go check.

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,480
This was our hot image, but let's check our application.

59
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,260
Let's refresh.

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Oh, we didn't actually resolve the category style, so we didn't remove that code right here.

61
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,720
We no longer have categories, styles because we deleted it.

62
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,470
And in our directory, we also did not import it.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,710
We just imported our directory styles file that we moved our styles into into our directory component

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,980
and then yes, we've removed the reference to that category styles file that we removed.

65
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,240
And now if we go back.

66
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,020
We have one more cannot resolve category item, category item component inside of our directory component.

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,550
So let's go back here.

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,620
Let's see what mistake we made here.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,850
Ah, here we see inside we've gone up from our Directory folder to our components folder.

70
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,670
We went into the category item folder and then we went and tried to find another category item folder.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,140
So this is duplicated.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,570
So everyone makes mistakes.

73
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,980
You're going to make a bunch of typos and you're going to make a bunch of errors when you're coding.

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,970
Always whenever that happens.

75
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,920
Take a breath and just really focus on where do you think the error is coming from?

76
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,200
We had Stack Trace, which is what we saw when we saw that error message in our browser that told us

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,920
where our error was.

78
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,590
And then it's just a matter of process of elimination.

79
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,660
What are the files that we changed?

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,380
Where could we most likely expect to see these errors from the stack trace?

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,630
And then it's just a matter of going back through all the possible cases and most of the time, honestly,

82
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,920
90 percent of the time.

83
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,100
A lot of our errors are going to be typos.

84
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,050
And now here we come back.

85
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,590
We see that everything is exactly how it was before.

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,280
So that's it.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,400
We've moved out and made this major companies major components now and now we can start building out

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,010
the rest of our application and thinking about what else to build.

89
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,070
But before we proceed, what I want you to do is I want you to go back to your terminal and now is actually

90
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,470
a great time for us to commit our code.

91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,450
So commit your code is just to make a save of your code because you really want to think about when

92
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,140
you want to commit.

93
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,150
Oftentimes you want to commit when you've done what feels like a contained block of work.

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,050
And for us, we just built out our directory page, which is a great time to commit this work.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,020
So we're just going to say, get, add dash.

96
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:46,600
Get commit and then are commit message, we'll just say updating our directory page with directory component

97
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,720
and category item component.

98
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,840
And then you can just push this up.

99
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,660
You can do get push for me because I'm using Zetia, which is my preferred.

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,310
I have the shorthand Gigi push.

101
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,140
There's a push up, and there we go.

102
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,550
Now in the next video, join me while we build out the next major feature in our application.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,990
I'll see you in the next video.
