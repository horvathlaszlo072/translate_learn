00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,100
In this video, we are going to type out our middleware.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,640
So our custom middleware is the logs.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,000
We want to rename this to logger that to us.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,230
And as you can probably guess, since this is a middleware, we're going to need that middleware type

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,940
that we had seen from before.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,210
Middleware, of course, coming from Redux.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,360
What we're going to do with this middleware is we need to pass it some arguments, one of which is going

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,690
to be the root state value that we had created ourselves.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,720
This middleware is going to be of the type middleware.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,620
Now, when you hover over middleware, what is it that it takes?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,760
Well, first, it takes some template dispatch extension.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,720
This is an extra dispatch signature added to this middleware.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,060
And you add it essentially as a type.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,940
So if you want to add more onto your dispatch, you can do so.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,680
But ours barely does that.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,360
We are never going to really modify the dispatch with this middleware.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,310
It means that if you want to add that functionality onto your dispatches, you're able to do so.

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,090
Some libraries like to do that.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,400
We definitely don't need that.

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,680
So for us, we're just going to pass an empty object or an empty type saying that we're not extending

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,310
it at all.

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,460
The second argument is going to be the state.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,720
This is the state of this middleware, and we are receiving the root state.

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,660
Third argument we don't need to pass anything for.

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,820
It's the type of dispatch that doesn't matter.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,960
We're not changing anything.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,190
We can just leave that empty.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,510
And there we go.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,400
We've typed out our custom middleware.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,880
We're done typing everything inside of our Redux folder except for our sagas, and we'll learn how to

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,930
do that in the next video.

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,040
I'll see you there.
