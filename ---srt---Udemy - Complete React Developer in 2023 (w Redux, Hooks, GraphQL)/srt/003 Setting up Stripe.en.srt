1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,320
In this video, we are going to learn about Stripe and integrating with Stripe, as well as setting

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,340
up stripe so that we can start writing our code to make payments against it.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,590
Strava is arguably one of the largest payment platform services ever made, and right now it is one

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,690
of the most popular, if not the most popular in North America and Europe.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,570
In order for you to get started, you need to have a stripe account.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,810
So to set up a stripe account, you get the sign in and then inside of the sign in page.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,160
If you do not have a stripe account already, you scroll down here and you hit the sign up.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,830
Once you've gone through the sign up process, join me back here where we will take a look at the view

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,870
that we first see with the dashboard.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,220
So once you've done that, come back and let's continue.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,120
Welcome back, everyone.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,890
So once you've signed in and registered, you will see this page.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,230
You'll notice that you're asking and being prompted to activate the account.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,900
The way to do that is that you have to give it your payment information, as well as your banking information

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,250
and your business information.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,170
So normally when you have a business, this is where that step becomes important, because only when

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,310
you do that are they allowed to legally let you accept payments.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,970
Here, though, we're just working with the actual developer experience.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,160
And the only difference is that once you actually have all of this validated and activated, you can

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,680
flip this from test mode to live production mode.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,620
As you can see here, it says, please activate your account to access live data.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,950
For us, this does not really matter.

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,640
The actual coding experience for us is the exact same and all we really need are these two values.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,070
If you scroll down here, you'll see for developers there is a publisher of a key and a secret key.

26
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,190
These are the two keys that I was talking about earlier.

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,100
The secret key being actually the most important one.

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,940
The publishable key, as you can tell, means that you can display this publicly.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,170
It's not a concern if people know what that key is.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,680
The secret key, though, is something that should be hidden.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,920
So this secret key should live on our back end or our serverless functions.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,400
What we'll talk about once we get to that section, the main thing I want you to do is remember these

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
two values.

34
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,130
We're going to have to go back to them later when we actually start integrating with Stripe.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,660
Now the first thing we need to do is install the actual dependencies so our React application can work

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,260
with Stripe.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,930
So let's inside of our terminal run yarn add at stripe slash stripe dash juice, which is the JavaScript

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,420
library that allows us to make Stripe payments.

39
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,610
And then we need add stripe slash, react slash stripe JS.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,870
This is the library that gives us the react elements and react bindings so that we can interact with

41
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,240
the Stripe library inside of the react environment in a significantly easier way.

42
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,240
So as these are installing, let's go back into our application.

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,090
The first thing we need to do is actually register our application so it knows to use Stripe.

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,140
Stripe provides us these react components known as Stripe elements that we can use, such as the card

45
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,790
component, which is that component we saw when I was typing in the credit card information.

46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,440
Stripe knows how to do that and use that in order to actually perform a payment, making the process

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,730
significantly easier.

48
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,110
But we have to actually register the application the same way that you what a provider.

49
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,130
So to do this what we actually need is going to be from the React integration from Stripe.

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,690
So here I want you to run imports and then elements.

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,300
From.

52
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:46,850
Stripe.

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,540
Slash.

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,200
React.

55
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,570
Stripe.

56
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:48,960
Jazz.

57
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,850
This elements is a component that you want to wrap around your app.

58
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,130
So this is similar to a provider.

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,380
Any components inside of this?

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,180
Elements will now have access to the stripe elements that we will use later.

61
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,350
But we actually have to pass this elements component something so that stripe knows that this is registered

62
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:18,890
to us, meaning that this React application, when it makes requests, goes to our specific account

63
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,490
in Stripe.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,880
Now this is where we're going to need that publishable key, and the way we're going to use it is inside

65
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,680
of this source folder.

66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,030
I'm going to make a new folder that helps us with Stripe.

67
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,470
You can also put it inside of your utils folder.

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,960
It really does not matter.

69
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,560
But since we have a usual folder actually let's use the utils folder here.

70
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,120
We're going to make a new stripe folder and inside we're going to make stripe charges or stripe dot

71
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,900
utils such as this is going to create and instantiate for us our Stripe instance.

72
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:02,550
So in order to do that, we need to import load stripe from stripe, add stripe, dash, stripe.

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,680
JS Load Stripe is what runs in order for us to actually know that this is our stripe instance.

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,530
So here I'm going to export out a contact called Stripe Promise and this is equal to us calling load

75
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,950
stripe and here we have to pass it the publishable key.

76
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,480
Now as I mentioned, the publishable key is perfectly fine for us to expose, but just for our own security

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,110
with these keys, we might as well put it inside somewhere safe.

78
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,590
This is where we're going to use something called env dot end is a environment file that we can add

79
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,990
that makes it so that only our application has access to these files because essentially it puts it

80
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,160
on your process environment.

81
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,600
It doesn't actually make it expose able anywhere inside of your code repository.

82
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,810
So the thing to do that we have to first out of file court and now because this application is made

83
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,840
in create racked up by default, the frontend React application allows us to use this dot and it's actually

84
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,260
already installed when we installed our Create React application.

85
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,960
The only thing though is that in order for us to use it, we need to make sure that any variables we

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,330
define include starts with react, underscore app, all caps.

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:27,400
So here I'm going to say react, underscore app, underscore, stripe, underscore publishable, underscore

88
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,320
key is equal to the string value of the publishable key.

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,640
So here I want you to go back to your application, copy the publishable key value and then paste this

90
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,800
into this section right here.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,080
So once you've save this, you will now have access to this value.

92
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,030
The one thing, though, is that we never want to actually push our file up into GitHub.

93
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,440
So what we have to do is in the get ignore add dot env.

94
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,030
So now get what?

95
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,710
Ignore our environment.

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,250
Moving on.

97
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,460
What we're going to do is go into our stripe utils.

98
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,020
Yes.

99
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,490
And now we can use this by saying process, dot, environment, dot, react.

100
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,210
Well, actually, here you can just directly copy the name.

101
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,580
I can't remember sometimes all these variable names.

102
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,220
But what happens is that under the hood, react will merge this file with our process environment.

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,110
So now all of those key value pairs we have are accessible on process.

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,360
And so now this is essentially going to load our stripe instance with our publishable key, which identifies

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,300
our application to Stripe as our application.

106
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,040
Then we're going to take this Stripe promise and we're going to import it into our index chassis because

107
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,040
as you can guess, this is what we need to pass into our elements that we get from React.

108
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,340
Right?

109
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,440
So here go to utils folder stripe, stripe, utils.

110
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,820
Strike promise here.

111
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
We're going to copy.

112
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:09,550
And then inside of elements right here, we are going to pass it as stripe equals stripe promise and

113
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,000
that's it.

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,640
This is what we need to set up so that we can start working with Stripe now and create the corresponding

115
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,120
components.

116
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,060
So again, dot end was the new thing.

117
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,890
If you want to add more environment variables that are accessible in your frontend application, you

118
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,410
want to always add react underscore app.

119
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,610
This only works of course in Create React app, but this is.

120
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,660
And so now that we have this, let's move on and start actually coding out our new Stripe components.

121
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,950
I'll see in the next video.
