00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,980
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,220
I just want to add a quick note here, I've actually ejected a create react app just to show you what

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,730
happens.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,790
You'll see here that it gives me a folder called Scripts and then a folder called Config.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,700
And in here, well, this was everything that the creator racked up was hiding underneath the hood for

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:20,910
us.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,240
You had things like just that was using for tests.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,780
We have our Web configuration.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,380
Remember our module bundler.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,760
You can see over here how long and intense and complicated it looks.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,700
We also have all the scripts that were run, for example, when we ran NPM Rumbold or NPM Run, start

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,830
or test, you see over here that it's quite a lot of code.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,920
This is why I recommend not ejecting, because no matter what, no matter how much time you spend with

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,570
react, you never going to compete with the developers that are working full time trying to make, create,

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,560
react, have the best tool possible developers that are getting paid to make this tool as easy and as

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,780
efficient for you.

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,440
So I recommend that you never eject out of a reactor unless you absolutely have to, because by using

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,140
create react app, we automatically get the best system and project build out of the box.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,030
And any time there are updates or the industry changes and there's new ways of doing things, create

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,140
react app is automatically, well, going to have a new version that has those changes implemented by

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,870
professionals.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,890
So again, I wanted to show you that this is what's happening underneath the hood, but ninety nine

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,890
point nine percent of the time, you don't really need to eject because you lose all the benefits as

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,830
a reactor gets more and more updates.

25
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,140
I'll see in the next one, bye bye.
