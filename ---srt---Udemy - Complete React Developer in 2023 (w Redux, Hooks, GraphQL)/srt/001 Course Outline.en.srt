00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,620
Hello, I'm very excited to start this course, but before we start everything, we need to figure out

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,230
where we're starting and where we're ending up, we want to have a clear path of success.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,400
This course is going to start off with some react basics.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,150
This is especially useful for those who have never ridden a single line of react or for those that need

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,450
a bit of a refresher in this section, we're going to learn about why REACT exists.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,970
We're going to learn about the fundamental principles so that you can tell people this is why REACT

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,020
has become popular.

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,460
These are the benefits.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,080
These are the pros and cons.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,120
And we're also going to build a fun little project to get us comfortable with react.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,130
It's a big section, but it's going to be a lot of fun by the end of this section.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,710
You're going to know react BASIX.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,840
I mean, that's what the section is called.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,370
But this is a fun park using the basics that we've learned in this section.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,340
We're going to right away start building our large e-commerce, how we're going to introduce topics

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:12,300
like React Router and Firebase to have different pages on our app and also do user signings.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,510
We're also going to start adding redux into our application so that it's ready to scale.

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,650
And then finally, we're also going to add payments using the stripe API so that people can actually

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,150
buy stuff from our store.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,280
And in this half of the course, we're going to have a fully fledged e-commerce app where we store user

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,940
information.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:43,800
We use Redux to store state react router to move between pages and Strib to actually make online purchases.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,190
And don't worry, we're going to teach you these topics from scratch.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,370
And this is where most courses would stop.

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,730
We'd have a nice app, you'd learn the basics and you'd feel comfortable working on a react project.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,630
But we take this a little bit further after we've in the fundamentals and we've built the main components

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,440
of our application, we introduce you to advanced topics like success, and we're going to convert our

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,610
app to use a popular library called Stallard Components.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,040
And then we introduce Redux Soga, a scalable way for us to handle asynchronous actions in our app.

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,320
Then things get even more interesting.

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,710
We actually start implementing hooks into our app and see how it compares with redux.

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:39,120
We also use contacts API again comparing it, how it's going to work with Redux and hooks and finally

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,160
even add graphics well to manage at an even larger scale our state.

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,940
And by this point we have done a lot in our application, but we take it a little bit further.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,840
We started implementing firebase features in different ways, even creating a stripe backend that you

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,070
can use so that our app can actually process payments.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,820
We even talk about complex topics like design patterns, including observables or high order components

38
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,210
better and even touch on an important topic of performance, how we can scale our applications and make

39
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,960
them perform it.

40
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,590
And finally, the last two bonus sections where we actually learn about progressive web apps and implement

41
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,510
our app as a progressive Web app.

42
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,200
And then a nice section on testing where we use the Gest Library to practice writing tests.

43
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,190
As you can see, there's a lot in here and this won't be easy, but we do promise you that we're going

44
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,750
to make it fun along the way.

45
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,710
And by the end of this course, this all is going to make sense.

46
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,490
These are going to be the skills that you will acquire throughout the course.

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,550
And by the end of it all, you would have had an app that implements all of these so that you can compare

48
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,970
and contrast, know when to use redux, when to use context API, when to use hooks or graph.

49
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,680
Q Well, you're going to be able to make smart decisions with any react project.

50
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,130
We're going to take you from zero to mastery and along the way we might throw in a little joke or two

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,740
to make it fun, whether you're new to react or you've taken a few reac courses but you still don't

52
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,180
feel confident in your skills.

53
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,890
This course is for everybody.

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,510
But the best part is this right here, our online community, we have over forty thousand developers

55
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,610
chatting every day in our little community here where we help each other out.

56
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,240
We work through problems together and we discuss the latest and greatest in the world of programming.

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,330
And this is an optional resource for you to use so that you can have back and forth conversations with

58
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,730
other students as well as myself and equal.

59
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,930
But you know what?

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,170
I can see you getting antsy and ready to start learning.

61
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,310
So enough talk.

62
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:53,970
Let's learn.

63
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,200
Let's get started.

64
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,610
I'll see you in the next one.
