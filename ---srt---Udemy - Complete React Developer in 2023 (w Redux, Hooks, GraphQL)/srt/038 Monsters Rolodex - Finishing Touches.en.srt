1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,290
In my last video, I asked you to move this into its own component, this card.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,160
So what we can do in this one is do that now.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,980
So let's create a component call card.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:22,230
So we'll initialize the folder and we'll say card talk component Duchess X as well as card dot styles.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,790
Dozier says.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,940
Inside of card component, let's do all of our setup, so we know we need to import the component class

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,690
from React.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,810
We also might as well import our style file because we know we're going to need the styles.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,910
Finally, let's initialize the class, so we'll say a class card extends component.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,820
And also, we need to make sure we export default the card, so I like doing all of this up front,

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,790
the setup for a new component just so that I remember it's easy sometimes for us to write our code and

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,190
then for things not to work.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,090
And we think that it's a bug when in reality, we're just missing some of the crucial steps that are

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,740
necessary in order for these cards and these multiple files to all work together.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,950
So by doing this stuff upfront, you're making sure that you get around that.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,760
We also need to make sure that we render something and in that render we return something.

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,490
So what I'm going to do is I come over, I'm a copy this code over.

19
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,080
So this is the HTML.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,030
And when we look at this HMO, what do we see that we're missing?

21
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,850
Well, we actually don't have all of the required variables.

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,710
We don't because we have an intern.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,480
And I think so here.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,840
What I want to do is I want to make sure that I structure off the ID, the name and the email, which

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,390
are the values that my component is expecting to use.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,690
And obviously, this is going to come in as a prop.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,270
What I want to do is I want to pass the entire object through by doing that.

28
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:08,560
I know that what I'm getting off of this props is going to be exactly that whole object and the object

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,580
should have these values.

30
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,640
There are ways that we can enforce this that we'll talk about later.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,700
For now, we are making a pretty small application where the only people coding on it, so we know what

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,740
it is that we're coming in, which is this monster.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,170
At this point, if we save this.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,210
And what we are going to do is replace the cardless component with this component.

35
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,760
So here I'm going to say card.

36
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,600
And instead of doing the restructuring here, I'm just going to pass Monster.

37
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,540
Like so as a prop that we set up.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
And then I'm going to import in.

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,520
Card from.

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,320
Hard Dash card component.

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,180
And let me save this.

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,790
And just to make sure.

43
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,790
Our code is still working.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,470
The other thing that we're missing now is moving the styles.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,300
We have card related styling inside of card list, and as I mentioned, yes, as is relevant everywhere,

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,710
which is why our stores still work.

47
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,530
But again, for the proper separation of concerns, we want to move this into card styles.

48
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,090
We've already done the import.

49
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,630
If we go back, we see that our code is still working.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,410
The last thing that we need to add is going to be the title.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,310
So here I'm going to leave it up to you to put whatever title you want into your application.

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,210
What I'm going to do is just go into the app.

53
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,620
And I'm just going to put an h one above the search box.

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,730
And here I'm probably going to want to move it a little or put some padding around it, so I'm also

55
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,230
going to give a class name.

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,050
Of app title.

57
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,320
And inside, I'm just going to say Monster's Rolodex.

58
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm going to save this, go into apps, assess and Target app title.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,410
Once we're inside, what I want is a margin top, oh, let's just say seventy five pixels.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,750
I want a margin bottom.

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Of, let's say, 50 pixels.

62
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,170
I want a font size of seventy six pixels.

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:40,600
And I also want a font, color or just color in this particular case of hash zero c c a c for.

64
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,310
Which is a light blue.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,350
At this point, you can also actually include a new font.

66
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,840
And if you're unfamiliar or if you are familiar with adding fonts into applications, typically what

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,120
you might do is might go on to Google Fonts and inside of Google Fonts.

68
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,550
You'll just find a font that you like and then you'll install the script into your HTML file.

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,630
So I'll show you how to do that.

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
You can pick whatever font you want.

71
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,590
I'm going to pick Bigalow rules.

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,740
Which is this one, because it looks kind of like monster ish kind of reminds me of Addams Family.

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,180
So here I'm just going to hit this plus to add the style.

74
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,890
And then all you do is you take this link, you copy this.

75
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,470
You go back into your application.

76
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,050
And let's just close all these other unneeded files.

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,910
In order for us to actually include it in our application, typically you put it inside of your indexed

78
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,540
HMO.

79
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,260
And for us, it's the exact same.

80
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,760
We have it here inside of our public folder and we're just going to paste this somewhere.

81
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,280
So I'm going to paste this right here and this will install in our Google Fonts.

82
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,120
So once I have the fonts, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into my apps to assess.

83
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,420
And I'm just going to say that font family is going to be Bigelow.

84
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,040
Rules.

85
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,110
Because this is the one that we just installed.

86
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,130
You see the name right here.

87
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,960
And then if we go back to our application, we'll see that everything matches now.

88
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,260
So this application looks pretty similar to this application.

89
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,710
I've got a little bit more padding or margin at the top.

90
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,700
It's up to you.

91
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,250
If you want to add less, add more.

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,090
You can tweak this however you want, but this is it.

93
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,070
This is our application.

94
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,650
Everything works as we expect it to.

95
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,440
You can clear the search bar and everything works.

96
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,250
And there you go.

97
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,220
This is your first project of as Rolodex, if any of this was confusing.

98
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,400
Please rewatch this series of videos because from here, we're really going to build a top the foundation

99
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,330
of everything we've learned.

100
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,340
And just to quickly go over.

101
00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:01,200
A lot of the main focus of what we wanted to understand about this project and react was primarily components

102
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,870
how they render, how they re render.

103
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,740
And the basic composition patterns that we need for react.

104
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,130
So now that we understand this, I'm going to go deeper with what we've just learned and you're going

105
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,500
to get a lot of practice with a lot of these concepts again.

106
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,530
We just work with class components and in the next video, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk

107
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,750
about converting these into functional components and some of the differences between class and functional

108
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,290
components.

109
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,250
So if you're unfamiliar with class components, just quickly go over them.

110
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,370
You'll get a good understanding of generally how they work.

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,950
And then in the next video, let's dive deeper into functional components and hooks.
