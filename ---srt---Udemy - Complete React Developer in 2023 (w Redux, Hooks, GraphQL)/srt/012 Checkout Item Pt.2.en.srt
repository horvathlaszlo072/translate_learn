1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,140
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,470
In this video, we want to create the actual checkout component and the checkout items inside.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,930
So when talking about our checkout component, let's take a look at what the final component should

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,380
look like.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,610
Really, what we're doing is we're creating some specific kind of ROE that will show what the value

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,400
of each column of these checkout items will be.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,220
So coming back here, let's start setting that up.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,940
We know we have our top level do and following typical fashion of these top level containers, we're

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,970
going to call this our checkout container inside.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,890
We know we need a device that will hold the header itself.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,170
So the header being those different values that we are adding at that row level.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,500
So I want to call this our class name of checkout header.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,660
Inside of this header, I want to have these different divs that represent the different blocks.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,240
So if you think about these, these are kind of like each of these individual duplicated sections.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,330
I'm going to call these, let's say, something like.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,730
Something like hetero block.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,790
It's pretty clear what these are and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this five times

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,140
because we have five different blocks.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,590
One two three four five.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,760
Now, inside of the first one, we need a span that will say product.

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,250
Then what we need for each subsequent one is going to be what they are.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,840
We have a description.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,000
We have.

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,220
Well, let's put description first.

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,160
So we have a description and then the next one, we have quantity.

26
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,780
And then after that.

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,420
We have our price.

28
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,730
And then finally, we have remove.

29
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:06,410
For our X button, which we haven't made yet, so here I'm going to get rid of all this other stuff.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,480
And underneath what we're doing is really we are showing the different items so I can either put this

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,140
in a div or I'm actually just going to get rid of this div now.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,280
I don't need it anymore.

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,180
And what I also want to do is display a total.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,570
So here I'm just going to put a span.

35
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,870
And inside of the span, I'm just going to say Total is equal to zero for now.

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,700
We'll figure out how to add the total later.

37
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,330
And I'm going to give this a class name of total.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,680
So what we need to do now is really just add in the style sheet that will allow this code to work.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,130
So once again, inside of checkout styles, just paste in your style sheet from your resource folder.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,430
And now once we've pasted this in, let's go back to our application and let's see how we're looking.

41
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,860
So far, we've got our header.

42
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,730
Of course, our total isn't in the right place, but we'll figure this out later.

43
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,170
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to set up the actual checkout items.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,740
So really, the checkout items are what's going to replace this temporary item that we've created here.

45
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,130
So let's go back into our components and let's make a new checkout item.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,930
Oops, I misspelled that check out.

47
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,460
Item.

48
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,750
And then let's set up our files.

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:47,340
Check out item dot styles access and then check out Item Dot Component Dot GSX.

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,680
Now, for the actual check out item, what we need to do is we need to import in our style sheet.

51
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,960
And then, of course, finish scaffolding out our checkout item component.

52
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,860
And then export default check out item.

53
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,350
Now inside, what do we know we get for the checkout item?

54
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,440
What we're going to get is essentially a cart item.

55
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,980
And off the cart item, we need all of the fields.

56
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,640
So let's deal structure off the name the image URL.

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,990
The price and the quantity.

58
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:42,710
And then what we're going to do is return back a div that will contain all of these appropriate values.

59
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,020
So I want to give this class name of check out item container.

60
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,890
And then a div that will contain the image.

61
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,550
So here I'm going to make another class name image container because I want to declare the boundaries

62
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,080
of what this image is going to have.

63
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,760
And here I'm going to say source goes to the image URL and then the alt text, as we've done so far,

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,110
is just going to be the name.

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,530
And then after this, I want to make a couple spans, so I'm going to make three spans here and then

66
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,030
I'm going to make it do because in the div is where I want to put the remove button.

67
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,220
Now for your remove button, you want to use a special character, and this character can actually be

68
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,720
signified in HTML as ampersand hashtag.

69
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,740
One zero zero five semicolon.

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,880
This, in turn, will now create for us that X button, but in a specific type of format and in quite

71
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,520
a large size.

72
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,980
As for these remaining spans, I want to make class name.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Of name.

74
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,460
Class name.

75
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,420
Of quantity.

76
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,530
Here this will be a class name.

77
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,150
Of Price.

78
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,910
And then we need to respectively insert in the correct values.

79
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,680
So here I'm going to put a name, I'm going to put the quantity.

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,910
And then I'm going to put the price.

81
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,890
And then it's just a matter of bringing this into our checkout component.

82
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,150
And replacing all of this.

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,390
Once we imported it.

84
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,050
Check out item.

85
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,540
Check out item component.

86
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,090
And then let's render our item.

87
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,540
Where the key is going to be, our car item died.

88
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,370
And Cartwright.

89
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,190
Is going to be car item and then we don't need this deal structuring anymore.

90
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,310
And as a result, we can just.

91
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,790
Explicitly, one line return these values.

92
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,760
Now, the last thing that we also need is the check out item styles, so go into your resources folder,

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,700
grab the style sheet and then paste it in here as well.

94
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,560
Now, once you've pasted this in, let's come back to our application.

95
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,390
And here we go.

96
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,440
We see that we have our components, although this icon looks like to be incorrect, so let's actually

97
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,120
take a double check into what that check out item component has.

98
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,350
It has Ampersand Hash Tag one zero zero zero five.

99
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,970
I was missing an extra zero.

100
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,010
And now if we come back here.

101
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,520
There we go.

102
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,050
This now looks correct.

103
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,360
So our total is also looking a little weird here.

104
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,690
So let's go into our checkout components and here we see the class name has a capital T..

105
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,400
That's another mistake of mine.

106
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,670
And now there we go.

107
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,840
Accurate Total.

108
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:30,460
So now all we need to do is we need to attach the quantity arrows as well as build out this remove button.

109
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,000
So the quantity button, that one is pretty easy.

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,590
We can do that in the next video.

111
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,140
But before you move on, I want to challenge you now to try and build out this remove feature when you

112
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,590
hit this.

113
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,800
This should in turn, remove this item from the cart.

114
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,920
So this should be pretty intuitive because we've kind of done it already when we talked about our quantity

115
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,650
equals one condition far remove item from cart.

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,160
So try and think about that and build that feature to remove the cart item and then I'll see you in

117
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,850
the next video.
