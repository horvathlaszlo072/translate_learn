00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,200
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,260
In this video, we're going to learn how to leverage our products that we've inserted into our shop

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,170
page in order to build out our cart.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,440
Our car is primarily comprised of two things.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,780
We have our car icon with a number inside that tells us the quantity.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,030
And we also have the car dropdown, which contains different items inside of it.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,080
As we add, items will notice that the numbers will increase, as well as the total quantity.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,980
If we add the same item in order to build this, we need to take this product and actually transform

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,310
it, potentially into a format that this cart is able to take so that it can accurately account for

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,060
the quantity.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,930
There's numerous ways to do that, but we'll talk about it in a little bit later.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,800
First, let's just initialize and set up our cart icon, and we can start with building out the dropdown

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,190
as well.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:06,690
So inside of your project, I want you to go to your assets folder and add in the shopping bag SVG icon

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,210
that I've included for you in your resources folder.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,910
So here you'll see what the SPG looks like.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,620
So what we want to do now is actually create a new cart icon component that is going to contain both

18
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,980
the count of the cart items as well as the SPG itself.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,810
So let's make a new folder called cart icon, and let's add the relevant files.

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,470
We need a cart icon, dot style dot size and we need a cart icon dock component Dargis X.

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,860
Inside of the car icon component, we need to import in our styles file, of course.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,530
And then we need to initialize the car icon functional component.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,500
And then we just need to export default, this cart icon.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,850
Next, what we also need is we need to import in the SVG, so as we did with our logo, we say react

25
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,630
component as and then whatever we want to call it.

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,010
I'm going to call it shopping icon and we want to import it directly from the file location.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,300
Once I have this shopping icon now, let's think about what our car icon itself should return.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:30,570
We want to return back a div that contains both the SVG of the shopping icon and also a span that holds

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,260
the actual number, which is the count of items we have so far.

30
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,390
So let's initialize it as 10 for now.

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,340
And what we also want to do is we want to make sure that the styling of this works so that the number

32
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,410
overlaps with the shopping icon in order to do that.

33
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,960
We need to provide some class names that make these elements targetable by our CST.

34
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,290
So here I'm going to call this the car icon container.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm going to call this shopping icon with the class name.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,220
Of shopping icon.

37
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,430
And as for the span, let's call it with a class name of item count.

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,260
So now let's save this and then inside of Kodak on styles.

39
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,870
I want you to paste in the icon styles file that I've also included in your resources folder.

40
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,960
Now, once you've pasted this in, what we're going to do is we're going to add this into our navigation

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,410
component.

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,580
So here inside of navigation bar, what we want to do is we want to import in our new car icon component.

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,170
So let's just figure out where this could go.

44
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,240
Let's say it before the contexts.

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,940
Let's import in the car icon from our correct placement.

46
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:52,340
Go up to the components folder inside of components or go to card icon and then card icon component.

47
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:02,570
So as far as the icon itself is concerned, we want to place this inside of the actual options container

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,920
because it sits right beside all of the options that we have.

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,000
So here this is actually one of those cases where you kind of want to think about the structure of what

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,420
you have.

51
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,770
We can place it right after our last sign and link.

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,450
Like so and then if we save this, we go to our application.

53
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
What do we see when we refresh?

54
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,660
There we go, there is our icon.

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,530
So right now, there's no interaction with it, but it's placed in the right place.

56
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,310
One other thing that is different in our application and the final output is that there is this additional

57
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,470
padding around the entire application.

58
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,720
So let's also add that in.

59
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,100
To do that, what we're going to do is go into our top level style sheet, which is our index, not

60
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,580
SAS.

61
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,760
And then inside of body, I'm going to add padding 20 pixels, 480 pixels.

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,610
So what this is saying is I want 20 pixels on the top and the bottom, and I want 40 pixels on the left

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,240
and the right side.

64
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,230
So now there we go.

65
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,430
We get a little bit of padding, so it looks a little bit better.

66
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,620
After this, what we need now is to actually build the down, so similarly, what I want to do is I

67
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,430
want to go into my components and I want to create a new folder called Cart Drop Down.

68
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,700
And inside of car drop down, I'm going to make both the relevant files.

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,440
So the car drop down dot styles dot SAS, as well as the cart drop down dock component such as sex.

70
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,000
Inside again, let's import our stylesheet.

71
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's initialize the cart drop down component.

72
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,170
Just the base scaffolding, and then let's export as default, the cart drop down.

73
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,040
As for what we want to return for now, let's just create this div.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,060
And inside of this car drop down, really all we need is before we think about what's actually inside,

75
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,940
let's just do a basic div.

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,130
And let's give it a class name of cart drop down.

77
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,890
Container.

78
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,860
We'll have some area here where we'll just make a temporary div just so that we hold the place, and

79
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,160
let's just say that what this will contain is are cart items, for example.

80
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:48,520
And then after that, we want a button that will allow the user to go to the checkout page, which is

81
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,160
what we have inside of our final application.

82
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,200
So we're just recreating this structure here.

83
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,070
So this means that we need to import in the button component.

84
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,040
So let's import in button from.

85
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,930
Button.

86
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,670
Component.

87
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,100
And here we just place the button and inside, we'll just say go to checkout.

88
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,550
Like, so so let's save this.

89
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,450
And now inside, as you guessed it, with cart drop down dot styles, I've also included your final

90
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,330
third stylesheet for this video in your resources folder.

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,730
So just take the cart, drop that style sheet, paste it in.

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,750
Now, once we've pasted this in, what we need to do now is we need to move this into the correct place

93
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,710
so that when we actually interact with it, we can see it.

94
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,920
So the place that this needs to go is also into the navigation component because it's essentially going

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,380
to live relative to the navigation bar.

96
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,780
So here I'm also going to import in our cart drop down from.

97
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,910
The components.

98
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,800
Components.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,190
And then the car to drop down car drop down component.

100
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:13,220
And where I want to place this is I want to place this outside of this actual options container, so

101
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,330
all of these nav links.

102
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,880
These are not important to me, but I still want this to be within the actual navigation.

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,640
So here I'm just going to add it right after.

104
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,230
And now if I save this and I go back to the application.

105
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,270
If I refresh.

106
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,510
We should see it up here, right here.

107
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,800
So that's good.

108
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,120
This is what we're looking for.

109
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:42,890
So we want to now add the functionality where we can toggle the actual showing of this card.

110
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,730
This is where I want you to make yet another context, because that context is going to contain the

111
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,680
information regarding the items into the car, as well as whether or not it's open or not.

112
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,310
So that is another challenge I want to issue to you.

113
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:08,270
I want you to create some way for us to be able to store the state of whether or not this cart draw

114
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,830
dropdown is open or not.

115
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,960
And I want you to trigger it on click.

116
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,430
So give that a try.

117
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,010
Figure out how to create that context using the knowledge that we have so far and then buying the ability

118
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,530
to turn it on and off or hide and show this.

119
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,480
Using that logic.

120
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,290
So do that and then join me in the next video where we'll do it together.
