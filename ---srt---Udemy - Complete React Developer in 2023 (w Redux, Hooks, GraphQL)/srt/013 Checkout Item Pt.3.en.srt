1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,520
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:10,940
So let's build out our final actually clearing out the item from this cart, so to do that, what we're

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,020
going to do is go into our car context, such as and inside of here.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,350
I am going to add yet another function called clear item from cart.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:30,260
And this is going to be a function that is just going to be very similar to our remove item from cart.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,010
And here I'm going to call it clear item from cart.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,690
Of course, it's going to be including the item to remove.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,490
And similarly, we're going to call it clear cut item.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,780
So let's talk about how to do this.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,620
Let's make a third helper function called Claire Cart item.

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,530
That is going to receive the car items because as we know, we need to probably utilize this card item

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,270
to give us back the new card.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
And then there is the cart item to remove.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,600
In fact, we can even be a little bit more explicit, we can call this car item to clear.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,350
Because we already did carte items removed here this way, at the very least, it's a lot more visually

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,240
clear for whoever is reading our code.

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,760
So what we now need to do is think about what we did before here, if the quantity matched to one for

18
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,700
some existing cart item, then we filtered it.

19
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,730
So really, this is all we need.

20
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:48,200
This portion of the coat, because all we're doing is we're saying, Hey, if the item you're trying

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:56,060
to clear out from the carts is equal to the crime that's already there, then just filter it out completely.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,170
So this alone is actually all the code we really need.

23
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's test this out.

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,470
So let me just make this a one line return once again and then.

25
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,450
Down here, we're calling it.

26
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,270
We can just add this to our value.

27
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,380
And let's import this into our check out item component.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,630
And inside of our check out item, we need to attach it to this.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,750
So in order for us to do that, we need to import in.

30
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,520
Use context from React, and we also need to import in our context.

31
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,060
And then inside here, I want you to pull in clear item from cart.

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,380
Equals use context, cart context.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,140
And then if I just add this as a on click.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,750
You know what, let's do our typical pattern where we create a separate handler and we'll call it our

35
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:26,290
clear item handler, which is equal to a callback that will call this passing in the cart item like

36
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,680
so.

37
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,690
Then here we can now do.

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,420
On the click.

39
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,460
Which is equal to clear item handler.

40
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,140
And now if we go back to our code.

41
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,100
Again, we need to include it in some items.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,630
Go back to the checkout.

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,520
And now, if we hit this, there we go.

44
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,910
We got rid of all the quantity of that great brim hat, and as we can see, we've reflected it everywhere

45
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,390
possible.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,960
So what we need to do left is also attach on the increment and decrement that we previously kept inside

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,980
of our checkout component.

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,540
So here we can actually just cut this because we're going to need it anyways.

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,900
Come over back to our checkout item component.

50
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,050
And add this on right here.

51
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,960
And then what we need to do beside the quantity for these spans is also include the arrows.

52
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,940
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to add to dips into this span.

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,810
And what I'll do is that for each div, I want to give it a class name.

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,660
Of Arrow.

55
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,760
So let's duplicate this on both sides.

56
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,470
And then what I'm going to do is I am going to.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,860
Actually, add a left and right arrow inside of this.

58
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:04,880
So the way that this works is that you're going to use another similar symbol this time it's going to

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,950
be Amerson hashtag one zero zero nine four semicolon.

60
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,170
This one is for the left work facing Arrow and then for the right word facing Arrow, you're going to

61
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,490
use five.

62
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,860
As for this quantity, we're going to want to make sure to wrap this in a span because we're going to

63
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,900
need to style this quantity now so that it accurately shows what we need to show.

64
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,480
So here I'm going to give it a class name.

65
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,140
And what I'm also going to do is now just add the on click for our arrows.

66
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,840
So I'm going to say on click is equal to let's create our handler's contest ad item handler.

67
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,630
And this will just be a callback that calls add item to cart.

68
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,930
Passing in our car item.

69
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,770
And we'll do the same for the remove item.

70
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,160
There we go.

71
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,260
Now, if you're wondering, why are we creating these outside handlers rather than just putting these

72
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,920
anonymous functions directly into these on click areas?

73
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,650
This actually has two purposes.

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,490
The first one is that if these methods ever change, we have a very clear idea of where these definitions

75
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,750
are rather than being inside of our assets.

76
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,610
They're in a place where we know we instantiate and initialize all of our helper functions and anything

77
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,100
like that.

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,500
It's just for code clarity.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,960
So it's easier to update these if need be.

80
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,030
The other reason is because by doing this, we're actually going to be able to optimize this code later.

81
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,120
But I'm going to talk about that later when we get to the optimization step.

82
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,410
For now, we're still in just the building functionality step of this code.

83
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,880
So let's add these on to the appropriate places.

84
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,280
And oops, sorry.

85
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,460
The top one is actually going to be the remove item handler and then the bottom one is going to be.

86
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,450
The ad item handler.

87
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,340
So now if we save this.

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,860
Let's just double check in our check out item styles in here inside of our quantity and all of these

89
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,810
other values, we are indeed adding in the appropriate styles.

90
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,970
But let's think a little bit about whether or not we need to update our styles, especially on quantity.

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,930
So in the quantity we added in this additional arrowe div that contains the left and the right arrow,

92
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,840
we want to make sure that whenever somebody hovers over them, we do a cursor pointer and ask for the

93
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,160
value in the middle.

94
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:49,540
The reason why we added the value is just so that we can say, Oh, give me a left and right margin

95
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,530
of ten pixels.

96
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,980
So now if we save this coat, we come back.

97
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,470
We see that we have a little bit of wonkiness here.

98
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:06,570
So what we need to do here is we need to modify this quantity to have display flex so that now.

99
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,150
There we go.

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,430
We have everything looking like how we need it to, and we can increment this quantity and we see it

101
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,140
reflect appropriately in our cart.

102
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,710
And that's it.

103
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,430
Everything is working, as we expect now before we move on.

104
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,280
One last thing to do is to figure out how to correctly display the total.

105
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,520
We need to be able to iterate through all of our card items and figure out what the price is versus

106
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,040
the quantity of all of those card items.

107
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,480
So that's my challenge to you.

108
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,010
Figure that out, and let's do this last thing together in the next video.
