1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,200
So we've learned that React takes care of domme changes for us using something called Virtual Don,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,810
we learned that we build the websites with components and this idea of uni directional data flow where

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,600
data only flows one way so that it's easier to debug our code.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,400
Then the final thing that really made react stand out is this idea of, hey, I'm just the UI, the

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,810
rest is up to you.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,610
What do I mean by this?

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:39,890
Well, remember how with Angular it came with all these things built in that is angular JS.

8
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,530
It was a framework and a framework is kind of like a whole kitchen.

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,110
It gives the developers all the tools necessary to build an application.

10
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,400
So if you're a cook in a kitchen while you get the oven, you get the nice, you get the drawers, you

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,210
get the pots and pans, you have the stove, you have everything for you.

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,850
And this is how you cook or this is how you build a website.

13
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,950
It's very opinionated.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,420
On the other hand, React said, hey, I only care about this whole idea of components and virtual dom

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,010
and I only am going to work with the view, the user interface, everything else that you need.

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:33,020
Well, you can just use other modules, other libraries and mix and match and have whatever you want

17
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,970
customized to your need.

18
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,000
So it was a library, a UI library, which is not like a kitchen.

19
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,010
It's more like, let's say the stove.

20
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,790
They gave you the stove to cook your soup on.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:54,430
But everything else like knife cutting board spoon, well, you can pick whichever one you want.

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,170
It's up to you what you use to build that soup.

23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,090
All we give you is this oven.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,090
And the key idea was that because it was so small.

25
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,940
You can learn once and write anywhere.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,960
What does that mean?

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,970
Well, react doesn't make assumptions about what technology stack use.

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:24,760
All we give you is, hey, here is this idea of components of a blueprint that we can use a massive

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,980
JavaScript object to make changes.

30
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,850
And here's also a robot that will interact with the DOM and makes changes for you.

31
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,020
But because of this, we actually are able because it only focuses with the UI, we're actually able

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,190
to move react to other places other than, well, let's say the Web, for example, we now can have

33
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,970
different robots that interact with different views.

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:03,650
And all they need is this main react library or blueprint of how to, well, look at a JavaScript object

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,550
and say, hey, change this UI.

36
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:13,400
So now you could have things like react native and this little robot can look at this blueprint and

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,790
say, change the view in a iOS and Android app.

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,880
And although it might not know anything about the DOM.

39
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,450
It only needs to know about views in a mobile app.

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:36,050
You also have things like React 360, which is VR apps, and again, using this blueprint of react,

41
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:42,050
I can use it for VR apps and this little robot or library can focus on VR.

42
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,070
We also have things like Electron and React desktop that allows us to build desktop applications and

43
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,070
they interact with Windows and Mac OS and Linux operating systems.

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,830
We even have things like react to blessed that work with the terminal and the command prompt.

45
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:11,090
And because of this reactor was able to use this concept and have developers that originally just wrote

46
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:18,620
for websites on the browser to now use the same idea and the same principles and the same JavaScript

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,370
code to build desktop applications, to build VR applications, to build mobile applications.

48
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,110
And this idea of cross platform really took off with react.

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:37,570
And you'll notice when we start building our projects that we actually import to libraries and react

50
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:46,030
the core react library, which is this little robot and the React Dom library, which is this specific

51
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,250
robot that only knows how to interact with the dump or the Web browser.
