Hello and welcome to the best Riak course online.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,820
Wow, that's a that's a bit of a bold statement and OK, I may be biased here, but I'm definitely looking

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,880
forward to us diving into some fun topics and coming out the other end as great react developers.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,270
This course tries to build onto each topic and gets more and more advanced as you progress.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,880
Trust me, if you go through everything, you will come out the other end confident with react and be

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,970
able to manage or even lead react projects.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,720
Your company.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,750
Now, before we dive into Cotting building projects and learning about react, I want to take a moment

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,310
and understand why React exists, what problem does it solve, why it makes frontin development easier,

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,630
and also what principles we need to understand to be more than the average reactive up.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,180
You see, a lot of times people learn a tool, a library or a framework without understanding the core

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,190
principles that make it great.

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:09,270
By learning these things first will have a foundation as we move through the course and understand what

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,710
the best practices are.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,990
The goal of this course is not to be another Reacher's like thousands of others already out there in

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,540
existence.

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,220
The goal is to make you a reactive helper that can think on your own, make good architectural decisions

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,800
and lead projects instead of only following tutorials.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,640
Therefore, in this section, let's dive into the important principles that will help us get through

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,210
this course.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,310
If you are new to react, some of these principles may be hard to understand at first.

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,870
Rest assured that we will keep revisiting them throughout the course as we learn.

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,340
For those that have already worked with react, you may learn a thing or two.

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,260
So hang in there.

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,700
My goal by the end of this section is for you to be able to explain to other programmers the benefit

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,310
of react without writing a single line of code.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,350
I do recommend that this section is something you come back to after you've watched through the entire

28
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,770
course.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,690
All right, enough talk, let's get started.
