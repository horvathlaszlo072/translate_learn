1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:09,350
OK, everyone, let's continue with modifying our application to be more mobile responsive, so the

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,990
next thing I want to update is our header component.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:20,090
So our header right now is not optimized for the mobile view, so inside of our hairstyles, I'm just

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:28,760
going to modify the actual width and height to be a little bit more aligned with the actual browser

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,880
view inside of a mobile device.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,280
Now, inside of this heter container, we are going to just paste in that same media query that we had

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,700
before.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,680
Because we're using the same media query in any of our mobile style changes, so here what I'm going

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,450
to do is I'm going to write it so that what I want to set in terms of the actual header container is

10
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,030
I want to shrink the height to 60 pixels instead of 70 pixels, just literally shaving off 10 pixels

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,210
here.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,200
I want to make sure that there's some padding all around the header of 10 pixels, and then I'm going

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,480
to have a margin bottom of 20 pixels so that we push the content down with our new header.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,360
So with that, we need to now modify the actual size of the components inside of the header, but the

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,120
header is shaped more like how I want it to be.

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,720
Now, inside of the actual logo container, I am going to add in this media query again, and what I

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,280
want to change is I want the width of this logo to be way smaller.

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,100
So I only want it to be 50 pixels.

19
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,710
And then I don't want any padding anymore.

20
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,560
I just want a padding of zero.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,050
So now if we go back and we see we see that our logo is more aligned with where we want it to be inside

22
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,640
of this header now.

23
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,690
I also want to make sure that the options container, so that section containing the option links we

24
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,130
have that navigate us to different Web pages.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,120
I want to make sure that that is now taking up more of the space of the header than before.

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,760
Before it only took up 50 percent of the total width of the header because with so much real estate

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,880
space with a Web view, instead I'm going to do a width of 80 percent.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,750
Because the only other thing on this browser page, when we're in this mobile view or in any of you,

29
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,340
in fact, is just the logo.

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,240
So now with this with this way, we have way more space.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,990
As we can see.

32
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,660
In fact, everything still works, which is really great for us.

33
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,590
We just need to make sure to update our views, like our homepage, to also be responsive.

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,830
Now, what it is that I want to change is I want the menu item to fit in a nicer way.

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,340
So what we can do is go into our menu item styles.

36
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:13,390
And modify them so that they have a similar media query and then render a different shape on the actual

37
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,590
menu item container.

38
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,630
So as you remember, we set the height based on this size property, which does dictate to it how big

39
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,560
it should be based on which image it is.

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Because when you remember inside of our Web view, the men and women sections are larger than the three

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,520
other sections that we have.

42
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,860
Now, what we want to do here is we want to actually modify this height value so that it stays pretty

43
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,930
consistent regardless of size.

44
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,220
So what we can do is at the end, append our media screen query and what we'll just say is simply height,

45
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,040
two hundred pixels.

46
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,890
Now, media queries have a higher specificity than anything else inside of our styles.

47
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,170
So no matter what styles inside of this here, the media query, if it has the same style, will always

48
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,800
overwrite the styles here because media queries always have a higher specificity order than regular

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,340
selectors.

50
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:23,860
So now if we go back, we'll see that our elements are aligned much better because the heights are statically

51
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,090
two hundred pixels and the widths will always adjust.

52
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,750
So the screen will try and fit these elements on the page in the right order that they have access to.

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,100
And then the moment that a new one starts on a new page, it fills the remaining space.

54
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,180
But the height is always set to a specific static two hundred pixels.

55
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,200
So with that, we now have a mobile view.

56
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,030
Now our home page is set up, the next thing that we need to modify is our shot page.

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:03,140
Our shop page is going to be a little bit more complicated because our shop page, it doesn't look terrible.

58
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,670
We have these elements.

59
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,390
But the problem with this is that this item you have to actually click it in order to see the add to

60
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,380
cart, which you'd then have to click instead with a mobile view.

61
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,760
This button seems too small in order to just put here the style and the actual design needs it to be

62
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,120
a little bit more deliberate in how we can actually add items because we want our users to be able to

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,900
add items as easily as possible.

64
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:40,640
So what we're going to modify is both the collection preview as well as our actual collection item.

65
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,880
So let's go back to our application code.

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,930
And what we need to do is go to the collection item styles.

67
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,430
Now, I do think actually I have a slight typo in our collection item here.

68
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,590
I accidentally put collection styles.

69
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,130
Dot styles such as this should actually be a collection item that style.

70
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,640
Such as?

71
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,700
So if we make that modification, we also have to make sure that we update it here now, mine automatically

72
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,900
updated it for me because my vote code is intelligent like that.

73
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:22,120
If yours is not, you just got to make sure to modify the place where you imported all of these components

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,340
in so that it's pointing to the right route.

75
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,900
Just a little typo, right?

76
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,270
These things happen to everybody.

77
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,200
So inside of our collection items, styles, what we're going to do is we are going to go into this

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,280
collection item container and we are going to modify how large this width will be.

79
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,180
Based on.

80
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:53,040
The actual mobile view, so inside of here, I want the width to be 40 view with meaning that it takes

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,370
up 40 percent of the total width of the full view.

82
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,180
Then I need to overwrite some of these hover features because these hover features I don't want inside

83
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,750
of my mobile view with our mobile view.

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,930
I don't care about the hover.

85
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,100
You don't actually hover that much with touch as you're used to it.

86
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,550
The mobile.

87
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,780
So what I'm going to say is that the image just unset, the opacity unset pretty much says that this

88
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,570
was never set in the first place.

89
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,100
So there's actually no image styles.

90
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,980
Here on the hover effect of the image when you're inside of this medium sized.

91
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,830
For any buttons in here, I also want to unset the opacity as well.

92
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,810
So now if we go back to our application.

93
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,020
OK, we'll see that we're looking at the wrong file.

94
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,910
This is probably because we didn't save this file, so once my visa code actually updated this route,

95
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,880
it didn't actually manually save the file for me.

96
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
So I had to manually make that save.

97
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,460
And now here we'll see.

98
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,420
This looks a little bit more tightly coupled because the width is larger.

99
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,260
The only reason it's still stacking like this is because we need to update our actual collection preview

100
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,490
view.

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,250
So what we'll do here is we will go to our collections preview.

102
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,590
Styles and inside of the preview container, we need to write our media query, so let's copy back our

103
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,000
old media query here.

104
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:33,770
And inside, we are going to say that I want this now to have a.

105
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,690
A line items property.

106
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,530
So this allows us to have everything centered.

107
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,530
Whenever our content is inside of this display, Fleck's.

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,300
Now, I know that this is a lot of success that we haven't touched upon before, if you're unfamiliar

109
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,520
with success, this might be completely new to you.

110
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:04,730
Honestly, this case is pretty extensive in terms of what rules there are, I'm going to link the flex

111
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,880
box ruling documentation for you.

112
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,080
It's actually an amazing resource to read through because it's really a matter of where the more you

113
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,580
practice with, the more that you'll see.

114
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,280
It's really comprehensive and it's difficult for me to cover inside of a course on reac because I'll

115
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,610
have to spend so much time on actual CSFs things.

116
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,810
So if this gets confusing for you at any point, I will definitely include a version of our application

117
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,510
where everything is converted to be mobile friendly for you.

118
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,670
Otherwise you can pause the video and read up on some of these styling rules.

119
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,850
If my explanations are not fully clear and you don't have the full context of everything, but it's

120
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,210
really just a matter of doing this on your own with practice, right?

121
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,630
So one of the other things that we have to do after we did this, a line items, is we need to modify

122
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:04,640
our preview container as well so that instead of being a display flex, what it will be is a display

123
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,120
grid.

124
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,900
Now, this is a new feature that I will also link the documentation for.

125
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,520
And this is another version of Display Flex.

126
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,220
We've actually used display grid before inside of our application, and it literally just lets us place

127
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,100
elements inside of whatever this top level component is in a grid like shape.

128
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:33,300
So here I'm going to say grid template is always going to just have columns where it's one F.R., whatever.

129
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,640
If you remember from that lesson on grids really quickly, one half hour just means whatever space is

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,300
remaining inside of this screen, meaning that there will always be essentially columns.

131
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,110
And the two columns here will each take up one full portion of the application, which means that they

132
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,290
are equally 50 percent of what space is available inside of this preview container.

133
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,230
And then I also want a grid gap of 15 pixel.

134
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,670
So grid gap is pretty much just.

135
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
The spacing between these elements, so with this now.

136
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,870
We see that our application looks more like that grid I was telling you about, right, there's always

137
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,480
two columns and they always take up one F.R. of space.

138
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,070
They're also 40 of you within size.

139
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,360
And there's a 15 pixel gap in between all of these items.

140
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,250
So now our application looks way closer to what we need it to be.

141
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,880
Now, the only thing missing is our actual button, so what we're going to do is we're going to go back

142
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,530
to our collection item styles and we're going to modify the button itself so that the button is always

143
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,350
displayed whenever we're in a mobile view.

144
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,110
We're going to say that the display is block instead of display none, so block is the default you can

145
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,280
do block or inline block.

146
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,210
We're going to make sure that the opacity is zero point nine.

147
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,280
We're also going to set a Menwith value where we unset it, the reason why we have to unset it, even

148
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,160
though it's not here, is because the button leverages custom button and custom button is a custom button

149
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,150
container with a Menwith of one hundred and sixty five pixel.

150
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,140
But that's too big for mobile view.

151
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,350
That's pretty much half our screen, so we just want to unset it.

152
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:33,360
And we also want to modify the padding so that what it'll do is it'll set a top value of zero 10 pixels

153
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,500
on the right, zero on the bottom, and then 10 pixels on the left.

154
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,580
So this way, we're getting zero 10 pixels, zero 10 pixels, in fact, you don't even need this.

155
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,170
This syntax is also the same way.

156
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
We just put two values for padding it, saying zero for top bottom 10 pixels.

157
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,640
Left, right.

158
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,410
And now if we save this.

159
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,090
We'll actually see that our button is always present, if we click this, we'll see that it still works.

160
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,100
Our items are being added to our check checkout.

161
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,290
Our collection preview is pretty close to what we actually want it to look like.

162
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,320
Now, at this point, I definitely encourage you to take a crack at trying to modify the styles for

163
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,470
the rest of this yourself.

164
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,730
It's a good exercise to maybe work on some success that we haven't really touched upon too much of in

165
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,100
this course, because this is a Riak horse.

166
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,760
Once you've played around with the stars, you can always check back to the GitHub for what it is that

167
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,400
we have done.

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,030
Now, I will also include a GitHub link of everything we've done up until this point right now.

169
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,740
So you have something to reference against.

170
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,710
But just like with all the other exercises that we did, this is a great chance to take some time of

171
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,080
your own to play around with some styling.

172
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,440
So good luck with that and always refer to the completed version and see how your styles match up to

173
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,940
mine again, mine is just my own attempt at the solution, right?

174
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,630
It's totally up to you how you want your application to look in a mobile view.

175
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,820
So with that, good luck with the exercise and I'll see you in the next lesson.
