1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,860
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,230
In the last video, we started learning about leveraging the roots and the root component from React

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,920
router Dom.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,920
We're going to dive much deeper into roots, especially because there's a lot that we can do with this,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,840
and there's a lot more nuance that we're going to learn about.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,790
But I want to highlight one quick thing.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,480
The reason why these components are able to connect to the URL and therefore render the appropriate

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,790
elements is because of the fact that these are nested inside of the browser router.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,770
You remember that I mentioned that you want to nest your application inside of the browser, router

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,220
component or whichever router component you choose to use and leverage.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,920
Most of the time it being browser router, because by doing this, you're extending that ability to

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,380
read from the URL and keep track of navigation history and all those things and respond in turn with

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,530
it.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:57,810
Because those components, the roots and the root component rely on being wrapped in an outside browser

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,560
router component.

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,600
So our app component is really just the entry point, but all of those components that we leverage are

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,430
now nested inside of browser router.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,170
So that's what I meant earlier in the previous lesson when I said, You want to wrap your application

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,240
inside a browser router so you can leverage the underlying browser functionalities when it comes to

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,900
navigation?

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,290
Now, inside of the home route, I have switched the path back to just the slash, and we're going to

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,040
die of a little deeper into understanding how this root component works.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,910
So you don't have to type this along because we're going to delete it anyways.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
This is really just to highlight a quick point.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,890
I'm going to make a really quick component, and it's just a component that renders an H1 that says

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,750
I am the shop page.

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,250
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this route and instead here I'm going to say when

28
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,430
you land on Dash Shop, render our shop component.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,020
So I'm going to save this and now we'll go back to our application.

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,450
If we navigate to slash up.

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,430
What do we see?

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,490
We see that we we've entirely removed the home component, and now we're rendering the shop component,

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,250
so everything here behaves as we expect.

34
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,860
We know that when we pattern match, we want to strip out everything that we had before, but now we

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,540
want to render in what's appropriate.

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,990
But as I mentioned earlier, what we want to show is this consistent navigation bar.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,250
So how do we do this?

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,640
Well, as it turns out, there's actually a few patterns that exist within our Dom and its components

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,530
that allow us to do exactly that.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,880
So in order to understand that, we're going to have to modify our code a little bit.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,900
The first thing we're going to explore is this concept of nested routes in order to nest routes within

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,500
the other.

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,220
What we do is instead of making these is just one line closed components, we essentially make them

44
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,810
components where we can embed children between them.

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,260
So here I'm going to take this shop route and I'm going to nested inside of the home route.

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,190
So instead of using the auto closing tag, I'm going to open up this component and the nest, the home

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,310
wrote.

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,540
Inside what this now does is actually a couple of things.

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,640
The first of which is it makes the path that's nested inside relative to the path of the parent.

50
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,140
So what this means is that you can imagine that for this route path to match now, it's going to have

51
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,510
to match the parent first.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,420
So slash.

53
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,810
And then it's going to have to match the inside, which is shot.

54
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,450
So I know this doesn't really seem any different from what we had before because before our path was

55
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,120
matching this anyways, but they're no longer siblings.

56
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,290
This is a child.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,090
So what this means is that if this top level was home in order for this to match, it's got to be slash

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,990
home slash shop.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,940
So let's just keep these paths so that we know what's happening here.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,890
So let's go back to our application.

61
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,530
We noticed that now we're no longer rendering on the empty plane URL.

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,540
Instead, we now navigate to slash home.

63
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,940
We see our home component as we expect.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,330
What do you think is going to happen when we navigate to slash shop?

65
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,710
Let's see.

66
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,540
Well, isn't that interesting?

67
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,250
We still see our home component, but we don't see our sharp edge component.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
Why is that?

69
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,030
Well, there's actually a couple of things to notice.

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,240
The first is that the parental component is still rendering, despite the fact that we're now matching

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,100
beyond the slash home slash up.

72
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,290
And this is one important thing.

73
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,130
This means that our parental component at that parent level route is going to render unless we tell

74
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,790
it otherwise.

75
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,460
So that's one important thing, and I'll explain how we do that after.

76
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,970
But the other thing is that even though we have slashed shot matching, our route is not displaying

77
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,690
its element.

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,950
Why is that?

79
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,540
The reason for that is because we have not actually told our code where we want this matching slash

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,310
shop component to go.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,390
The way that we do that is we actually have to go into our parent level component and we need to tell

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:16,810
it exactly where we want recruiter Don to render this nested matching element.

83
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,950
And the way you do that is you use another component that we get from recruiter Dom called an outlet.

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,660
This outlet, you can see as a outlet where the code that we want to render should come out from and

85
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,080
we would use it inside of our component.

86
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,580
Now, because as I mentioned, you always need one parent level component.

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm just going to make a new div and inside I'm going to render the outlet wherever you render.

88
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,670
The outlet is where when this route matches is going to render the element.

89
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,040
So shop here is going to render above the directory.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,010
So let's back to our code.

91
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,200
And here we see that's exactly what happened.

92
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,770
If I move this outlet below the directory, we see now it's below our directory.

93
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,690
So that is very powerful because the outlet now allows us to leverage this pattern matching and this

94
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:24,280
nesting structure in order to dynamically change portions of our code based on the routes and the nested

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,640
routes.

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,920
So with this in mind, we can kind of start to see a pattern emerge where we can keep the navigation

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,660
bar, but just change the content inside using a specific nesting strategy.

98
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,700
That's what we're going to do in our next lesson.

99
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,630
I want you to think about it a little bit first, just so that you're familiar because we learn something

100
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,830
really interesting just now.

101
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,030
And it might be a little confusing with these nested roots, but just really sit and think about it

102
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,540
a little bit.

103
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,550
And imagine in your head how you can imagine this composition we're about to do in the next video is

104
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,850
going to look so that we can maintain a navigation bar.

105
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,870
So think about that and then join me in the next video and let's do that together.
