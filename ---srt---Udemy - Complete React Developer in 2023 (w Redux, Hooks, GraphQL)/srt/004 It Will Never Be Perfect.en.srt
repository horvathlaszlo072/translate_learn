1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,690
This is a big one.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,410
This one I hold dear to my heart.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,880
And it's the idea that things will never be perfect.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,690
No matter how hard you study, no matter how many videos you watch, how many books you read, how many

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,920
projects you built, your code is never going to be perfect.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,550
A lot of people hold off on shipping a product or building something because they think they still need

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,450
to improve something.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,200
They still need to learn or they still need to add that feature at a buck.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,960
But the problem is that this is a continuous cycle.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,210
It's never going to be perfect.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
Things are always evolving and there's always going to be different ways that you can refactor code.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,060
Make things maybe more efficient, cleaner looking.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,230
The problem is when you have this mentality of, oh, I'm going have to wait until it's absolutely perfect,

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,070
is that you end up just bottling all this productivity inside you.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,720
But until you put out your work, until you do something in the real world to solve a problem, everything

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,470
is internal.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,330
All that code that you write, if nobody sees it, if nobody uses it, it might as well just not be

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:14,560
there.

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,550
So keep that in mind.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,030
It's better to just start doing something, start putting something out there, start releasing that

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,950
product, because no matter why you do, it won't be perfect.

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,330
What you want to do is constantly improve.

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,700
And the best way to improve is to get feedback on your code from other people, feedback on your product.

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,170
So I guess what I'm saying is stop watching these videos.

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,730
Close your laptop well, don't close your laptop where programmers, but close this video, open up

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,510
your code editor and start writing your project.
