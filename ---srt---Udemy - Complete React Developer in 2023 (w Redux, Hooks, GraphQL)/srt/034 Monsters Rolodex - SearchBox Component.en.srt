1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,730
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,550
So in this video, let's actually move out another component that we were talking about, which is our

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,420
search box.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,590
So here we already have our search box folder, so let's just do the same thing and create a new file

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,350
called search box component such as sex.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,090
Once again, we want to make sure we import component.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,950
From React.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,550
And then we're going to initialize our class search box, which extends component.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:45,540
And then inside of our render method, we want to return the actual HTML related to our search box.

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,670
So here I'm just going to cut this out.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,130
Go back here, paste it in.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,960
And before we actually figure out how we're going to get this into our component, let's just make sure

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,830
to also export our component just so that we remember to do this when we need to actually access this

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,390
component from the code that uses it.

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,130
So similarly, let's talk about props again.

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,920
We know that this input is supposed to be a generic search box component.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,460
What it does is it takes some text and it does something.

18
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,340
What that something is, we don't really know.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,770
However, here, how do we generate size, what this input is?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,210
Well, there's a couple of things here.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,130
What are some of the props of a search box that we know we want to change?

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,110
And what are the ones that we don't want to change?

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,040
Well, we know that we want to keep the tape search if this is a search box component.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
We want to use a search input.

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:52,200
Now, if you're unfamiliar what a search type on this input does is, it turns our input box into a

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
actual search box one.

27
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,340
And what that does is it allows us to actually generate this little x button.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,570
So when you hit it, it actually clears out the text, so automatically it builds that into the feature

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:06,870
for us.

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,980
If we did not have that, we would not be able to actually have that X.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,480
It would just be a normal input field.

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,930
So that's why we know that if we're doing a search box, we probably want that feature.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,700
So we want to keep this type search.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,740
But what about everything else?

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,780
Everything else, we probably want to make sure that they can be dynamic because we probably don't want

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,280
the class name to be search box for every single search box, that's not specific enough.

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,860
You can imagine that if an application has multiple search boxes, in order for us to be able to distinguish

38
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,580
search boxes from each other, they might need different class names.

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,140
So what we can do is we can actually.

40
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,690
Use another feature with props, but before I talk about those ones, let's just make sure that we first.

41
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,190
Enable are on change as well as maybe our placeholder.

42
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:09,880
So what we're going to do is we are going to first look at this on change and change is a callback that

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,740
runs whenever change happens on our input.

44
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,030
What that happens is up to the component that's trying to render the search box.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,450
Now you might be wondering, should we bring in?

46
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,530
This search field text into the change.

47
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,660
Well, let's think about that.

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
Where are we actually using this search field state?

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,590
We're actually using it inside of our app component.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,660
We're filtering down our monsters from the search field.

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,210
So that means that because this app component utilizes the search field value that our search box actually

52
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,970
has in order to determine what it's trying to do, which is to filter the monsters.

53
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,350
We actually need this string stored inside of this level.

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,760
Now, there's different patterns that you can do this, but this is a good way of thinking about with

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,570
react components.

56
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,780
So that means that what on search changed is as far as for our search box component in the current context

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,390
is it is just supposed to update APJ assist state search field value.

58
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,400
And that's exactly what our on search change method here does.

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,630
So we want to pass on search changed into the search box component.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,200
So let's think about what we're going to name this prop.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,280
Inside of our search box, we know that we're attaching it to the on change of the input prop.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,230
So what this is is it's an on change handler because that's the function we're passing a handler function,

63
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,640
an event handler.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,150
So what we can call this is exactly that.

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,710
It's an on change handler.

66
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,290
This stop prompts that on change handler.

67
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,840
So let's just comment this out for now, and let's just make sure at least this is working from what

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,310
we've again just defined, so I'm going to default, export it out.

69
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm going to copy search box.

70
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,690
I'm going to go into OPG's.

71
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,930
I'm going to import it from the respective file import search box from components Dash Search Box,

72
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,240
Dash Search Box Stock component.

73
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm going to copy search box.

74
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm going to go down to where it was before, and then I'm going to pass on Change Handler.

75
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,810
Which is equal to on search change.

76
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,200
And now if I save this.

77
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,170
Let's go back.

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,070
What we see is that because we can't set out our place holder, there's no place holder.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,980
But if we type in, we see that our application still works as expected.

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,910
Amazing.

81
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,520
So everything here is working now, this placeholder text.

82
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,510
We know that with a placeholder text, this might also change.

83
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,760
The search box is supposed to be a generic search box just because in this particular case, we're searching

84
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,000
for monsters doesn't mean all our search boxes are going to say search monsters.

85
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,440
So this is another.

86
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,570
Property that we probably want to change and make generic, so I'm going to do the same thing, I'm

87
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,940
going to say this stop props, stop placeholder.

88
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,460
And similarly.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,120
Let's just make sure that this works, and I'm going to say placeholder, which is equal to.

90
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,730
Search monsters.

91
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Actually, I don't need.

92
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,800
These squiggly backers for that, just say, search monsters, let's save this, go back and see.

93
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,540
They are two search monsters.

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Everything still works.

95
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,980
And finally, for class name.

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,480
Let's do the same thing.

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,440
We can hear say this stop prop stock class name.

98
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,130
And then similarly in J.S..

99
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,650
We do class name is equal to.

100
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,340
Search box.

101
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:12,480
And now if we save and we go back to our application, let's just make sure that class name is being

102
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,900
applied.

103
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,350
It is so everything here works as we had it before.

104
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,680
Now, one quick note is that you may be wondering why are all these other props named the exact same

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,890
as the base props such as class name and placeholder are the same prop name as the one an input, whereas

106
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,260
here for on change, I call on change handler.

107
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,610
You can call it on change as well in your property just to find them the same thing.

108
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,950
I just prefer to do it this way myself.

109
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,460
So it's a little bit more explosive for me with, especially when I'm writing my own components.

110
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,120
But again, it's a personal preference thing.

111
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,270
It might just be a little bit of a tick thing.

112
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,300
It's entirely up to you if you want to keep it the way that you keep it.

113
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,870
People will sometimes write these a little differently, just based on the preference.

114
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,250
Honestly, a lot of these standards of how you name your props is kind of going to be set on a project

115
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,110
by project basis.

116
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,890
Sometimes there are different rules, depending on who is the architect or the senior developer and

117
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,910
what they want to set it up.

118
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,740
As for consistency across the code base.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,570
This is just my personal quirk is that all of the change, if I want to name an event handler as a prop

120
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,910
that I'm passing in, I just say handler to be explicit.

121
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,830
That's a personal preference for me.

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,390
That is really all it is.

123
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,270
So we have a search box working, we have our cardless component working.

124
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,050
Everything here is pretty much going to be the basic setup for our components.

125
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,740
In the next video we're going to do is now just start styling everything.

126
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,490
And we're going to understand how X-Files work inside of React.

127
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,660
And through that, we're also going to understand how React builds our project a little bit clearer.

128
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,510
So let's talk about that in the next video.
