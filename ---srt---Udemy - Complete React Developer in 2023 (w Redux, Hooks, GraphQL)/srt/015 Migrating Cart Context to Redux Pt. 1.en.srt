1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,820
Now, before we continue with our car context, let's just make sure we've cleaned up everything up

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,800
until this point so far.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,660
In the last video, we added a few console logs that I want you to remove as well.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,140
If you have, then that's great.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,000
If not, please do that now and inside of your context.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,860
If you have not deleted your user context and your category context, please delete those as well.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,980
So with our car context, there are a lot of little micro functions, utility functions, as well as

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,980
a lot of the separation of logic that we did so far.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,970
There are a couple things that we need to think about when it comes to how we migrate this code over

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,840
into Redux.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,260
It's everything we've already learned, but there are just a few more steps.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,350
One key thing is that so far we've been storing our cart count and cart total actually on the reducer

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,920
itself.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,000
So here what we've learned so far is that with these selectors we can actually extrapolate out that

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,500
data and we can also make it relatively performance as long as we make sure to memorize them using SELECT.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,330
So that's what we're going to do.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,490
Beyond that, a couple other things we want to do is just make sure that we capture all of the logic

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,890
in the right places when coding this out.

20
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,540
So to begin, what we're going to do is let's go into our store and let's set up and scaffold all of

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,350
the things we need in order to get this redux up and running.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,820
So I'm gonna take the cart folder.

23
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,610
I'm going to make the action jazz.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,660
I'm going to make, of course, the reducer J.S..

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,270
I'm going to make the selector jazz, and I'm going to make the types jazz, all the things that we

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,510
need.

27
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,750
And then what we'll do is we will slowly migrate over into each of these files, the different things

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,620
that we've already created.

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,730
For example, we know that we already have the reducer and the initial state.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,280
We, of course, have to tweak some of these in order for this to work and fit our current model.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,590
So initial state.

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,280
And then the next thing we need to do, of course, we need to set our state equal to cart initial state

33
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,310
and our action equal to a empty object if no action is passed.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,290
Then by default we just also return the state.

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,380
The next thing we need is car action types.

36
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,080
So here, let's go to our car context.

37
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,660
Let's grab our car action types.

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,400
Put them into our cart types.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,770
And let's also add cards in front of each of these strings, because now every single reducer gets every

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,490
single action.

41
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,150
So we want to be very clear and explicit about which one should be receiving it.

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,530
And then what we need now.

43
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:08,730
Is we need to actually create and move in the types so we're going to import in our car action types.

44
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,230
Export out this producer and put this producer inside of our producer.

45
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,130
So here we have our cart reducer.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,020
We just attach it to cart like so.

47
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,060
And now for our first sanity check.

48
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,190
Let's just make sure our reducers actually inside of our application.

49
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,980
So here, when we initialized, what we see is our next data object.

50
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,550
And on the next day we see on cart we indeed have all of our initial values.

51
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,180
So there we go.

52
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,150
Have set up our reducer.

53
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:07,900
Now we need to think about the hard parts, which is the actions as well as the selectors.

54
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:14,920
So as I mentioned, our selectors should be what actually extrapolates out the logic that we had before

55
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,000
that we were doing when we were pushing the values into our reducer in context, because now instead

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,890
of doing it before it goes into context, we're no longer storing car count and cart total.

57
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,100
We want to extract that into selectors.

58
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,370
So to do that, what we need to do is just make sure that based on the cart items, we want to move

59
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,150
this over.

60
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,590
So let's copy this into our selectors first.

61
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,210
Let's also make sure to import in our create selector

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,870
from re select.

63
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:58,120
As far as the electoral logic goes, the key thing that we know that we need to extract off is the cart

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,570
items.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,670
So currently, though, we are storing cart total as cart quantity.

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,270
So what we can do is we can get rid of these values.

67
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,020
And we need to make sure as well that when we set, all we're setting now is just cart items so we can

68
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,960
just pass it as the payload, which will be our card items.

69
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,140
I think I'm realizing that when we look at our car context, I did not make a new set or a function

70
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,090
that uses reducer.

71
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,530
Instead, we're still using use date.

72
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,500
So this is an oversight on my part, but this is a very quick, simple setter that if you want it to

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,640
set, you can make it yourself.

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,390
Maybe some of you have noticed that I missed that, but it's no worries.

75
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,000
We'll do it now inside of our car reducer.

76
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,630
So all we need to do is just switch the case.

77
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,000
I believe, in fact, we even have a set.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,780
Is car open?

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,190
Yes, we do.

80
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,860
Is just an oversight on my part.

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,140
We just need is heart open to point to the payload which will pass as a boolean.

82
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,430
So for us let's create the actions that will do this here.

83
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,640
Inside, we want to import in our cart types.

84
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:19,760
And then what we'll do is we'll export content set is cart open which will receive a boolean and we

85
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,640
also need to import in create action.

86
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,570
Because what we'll do is we'll create an action with the cart action types set is cart open and pass

87
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,910
the bullion as the value for the payload.

88
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,490
Now for the remaining actions, this is going to be a little different when you think about the car

89
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,150
context.

90
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,700
The way we had a before is we had these helper functions that we exposed and what they did is they were

91
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,670
update the reducer, but we would also generate what the new car items would be here and do this as

92
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,740
these functions, this you can kind of see as your action creators.

93
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,330
All you need to do with the action is the action needs to figure out what to update inside of our final

94
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,990
reducer.

95
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,950
So what we'll do is we will make sure that our actions are the ones that do so in order to do this.

96
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,730
We will probably need all of these different helper functions that we've created.

97
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,070
So I'm going to copy these over first.

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,590
Move these at the bottom and each of them rely on some utility function that helps us actually derive

99
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,580
the new car items.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,760
So I'm going to copy these over as well.

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,140
And there should be one more for clear cart down here.

102
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,470
I should.

103
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,170
We should have moved this right here for more clarity.

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,850
But no worries.

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,180
We have it now.

106
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:01,860
And now it's just a matter of modifying these new action creators so that they actually do what we need

107
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,280
it to do.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,470
So what I want you to do is I want you to try and take a stab at this.

109
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,860
If you have already, that's great.

110
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,610
If not.

111
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,070
Just try and figure out, okay, now that we're inside of the Land of Redux, these actions now no longer

112
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,680
have access to items in the scope of the context.

113
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,450
We'll probably have to pass it in.

114
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,680
But before you do that, just think about when you're writing these actions anyways.

115
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,240
Understand the context under which they'll be used and what you might have to do in order to get it

116
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,690
to work.

117
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,610
So try that out yourself and then join me in the next video where we will code this together as well

118
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,190
as finishing up the rest of the set up for this cart.
