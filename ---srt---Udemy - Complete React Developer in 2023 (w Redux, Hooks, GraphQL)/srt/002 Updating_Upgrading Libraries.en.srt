00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,460
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,270
In this video, we are going to implement React router, which is version six right now at the time

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,700
of this recording into our application.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,030
If you're here from the previous two years of the last iteration of this application, you'll know that

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,010
we were running React router version five.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,610
And this is the first major version update with a significant amount of changes in terms of just the

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,320
implementation syntax.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,520
As far as how the actual library works and what it does for us, that is the exact same.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,220
It follows largely the exact same concepts we covered in the last video when we walk through how a web

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,130
application, depending on the route and the suburbs you navigate to, will either decide to keep or

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,640
remove and change different components on the page.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,140
And what those different components will be is largely up to our choice.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,430
The library just helps us execute on those decisions that we make.

14
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,560
So let's talk about how we actually implement React router version six into the application.

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,860
So here, let's just walk through the docs really quickly so that we get a good, familiar understanding

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,180
of majority of how most react libraries work for us.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,950
So you can either choose to read the docs or start the editorial.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,220
The great thing about starting the trial is you get to go through a very simple setup of how that want

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,510
you to walk through the major features of React router version six.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm not going to do it.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,670
I'm just going to show you how it actually is implemented because I understand how this routing library

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,940
works.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,460
But if you're ever curious, go through this material and just follow the instructions for this tutorial.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,330
It's really great.

25
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,970
You get to build a sample application and just see step by step how this routing is built from the bottom

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,210
up.

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,730
We're going to go through as well in our application, but this one is straight from the library creators

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,300
themselves.

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,660
But the great thing about the tutorial is they have to show you how to install the application and it's

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,980
honestly, really simple.

31
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,310
All we have to do is just initialize the actual library into our packages.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,800
So here they're really just using Create React app the way that we have to create some kind of tutorial

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,080
application that you can walk through in case you don't have one.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,540
We can skip all this because we already have all this stuff.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,760
But what we really need is we need this part where we install the browser router.

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,250
But first we have to install the application.

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,810
So then saw the application.

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,920
You just want to look here, install react router dependencies and be installed.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,490
React Router Dom at six, you can use npm.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm going to use yarn.

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,400
So let's go back to our terminal.

42
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,830
And let's install into our application rack router.

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,550
So we're going to say yarn, add react router Dom at six, so that's saying, Hey, give me rack router

44
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,750
Dom version six.

45
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,760
Now, the reason why it doesn't give you the latest one.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,670
Sometimes, depending on recruiter Dom themselves and the package maintainers, they may be having some

47
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,620
kind of conflict between a lot of these different versions that they're supporting.

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,770
Version five may still be the most popular.

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,740
They may be rolling out version six.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,410
Therefore, they want you to specify when you want six, even though it may be the major version they

51
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,840
support.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,220
Again, a lot of times these libraries are heavily dependent upon by the majority of different applications

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,470
in production that rely on them.

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,990
So there's a lot of heavy decision making they have to make when rolling out major versions, especially

55
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,610
ones that have sweeping breaking changes like version six in this particular case here.

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,340
Version six also is not backwards compatible yet at the time of this recording.

57
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,610
Meaning that if you have version five and you upgrade your application's library to version six, your

58
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,430
application will not work because version six does not support the features that existed in version

59
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,910
five.

60
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,320
So this is a very important thing to understand about a lot of these libraries.

61
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,700
They may want to make updates and they may do so, but often times there will be conflict in how they

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,430
do it because of the fact that with the upgrades, maybe they have better patterns or better ideas of

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,990
how they want this library to work.

64
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,060
Now, sometimes in order to do that, they may not be able to support the previous working functionality.

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,820
When that happens, they have to come up with a strategy and different libraries and different companies

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,400
that support these libraries may have different strategies, which is an unfortunate side effect in

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,670
this particular case with React router version six.

68
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,040
Some students who have taken this course when we were doing version five may have experienced a lot

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,380
of frustration trying to use version six because it's not backwards compatible with version five.

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,030
This is an unfortunate side effect of the libraries decision when they rolled out version six.

71
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,180
So this is an important thing to think about when it comes to when to upgrade a library.

72
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,510
So with rack writer Dom, I want to highlight one thing is that oftentimes in them, they'll have an

73
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,560
upgrade guide.

74
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,070
So if you watch the upgrade guide and go through it, you will understand some of the key features in

75
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,470
the upgrade from one major version to another.

76
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,460
Usually, they'll lay out steps about what components or what features have now been removed and of

77
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,640
not being upgraded.

78
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,010
And similarly, they'll also tell you when you can actually directly update the version.

79
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,040
So here, if you read through this guide, it really lists out the major steps required.

80
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,930
First, you've got to upgrade your React version to at least sixteen point eight or greater.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,570
So another thing to note about a lot of these libraries is that some of these libraries, depending

82
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,700
on the version of the library, you download it.

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,360
So in this case, React browser version six requires you to have a React version sixteen point eight

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,150
or greater version six of React router.

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,000
Dom will not work with anything lower than React version sixteen point eight, so that is one of those

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,490
considerations you may have to make when upgrading libraries.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:07,460
Another one is when upgrading React router version five point one and above you have to remove certain

88
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,030
components.

89
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,890
I know these might not make sense to you if you haven't touched version five, but the main thing that

90
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:19,010
this really shows you is that they may want you to remove old features, and they may also want you

91
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,480
to refactor certain code patterns from those old libraries.

92
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,090
That's all these two really represent at a high level.

93
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,830
So that's one important thing.

94
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,830
You may have to do this first before you actually follow through with the final step, which is where

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,320
you upgrade the version of the library itself.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,300
So these are some important things.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,220
If you don't do these properly, you may see a ton of breakages across your application, which may

98
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,330
be significantly more difficult to resolve once you've actually upgraded.

99
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,360
So this is one of those important things that it's a really good moment to understand about a very particular

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,970
case that does happen a lot when working with React, which is that some of the supporting libraries

101
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,940
that you use may go through major version changes.

102
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,910
When that happens and there are breaking changes, there is a process of going through the upgrade with

103
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,150
them.

104
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,940
It's oftentimes kind of painful, but it's definitely one of those things that is a great moment to

105
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,150
really understand how these libraries work with your application, but also the general development

106
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:27,140
cycle and life of a application that you're building in production as a professional developer.

107
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,060
So I just wanted to highlight this thing because it's really on top of mind and we actually went through

108
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,340
it together inside of this course.

109
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,620
Now, for some of you who have not gone through it earlier when we did version five, this may not be

110
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,990
as relevant to you in terms of the actual experience of building out the application and the capstone

111
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,660
project, but this is still a very good learning moment to understand that these things can happen.

112
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,430
And I just want to guide you through some of the steps that you can take in order to go through these

113
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,330
kinds of upgrades.

114
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,740
So it's really not that scary.

115
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,180
It seems way scarier than it is, but it's just one of those things that you just want to follow the

116
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,130
instructions and go through application.

117
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,780
Take it slow one by one and then finally make the upgrade.

118
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,630
So now that we have installed rack router version six and I've gone on this little tangent right now

119
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:21,110
about explaining some of these library changes, let's actually implement React router version six into

120
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,800
our application.
