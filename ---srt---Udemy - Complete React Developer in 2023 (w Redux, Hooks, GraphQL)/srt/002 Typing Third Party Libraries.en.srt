00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,620
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:10,440
Inside of any TypeScript project, there is a very likely chance that some of your libraries will throw

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,250
an error where you will see here, it will say could not find declaration file for module and then the

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,770
name of your third party library.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,390
What this means is that for that library you need to most likely install a separate types library,

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,030
which essentially will add TypeScript and typing to all of the specific required exports or modules

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,830
or whatever inside of that library.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,330
So that's generally very simple.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,830
Most libraries have a at two types, and in fact, you'll even see that they will tell you to suggest

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,310
to try and save inside this specific library.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,800
So they always begin with at types slash and then the name of the third party library if it's not automatically

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,410
included in the library as a dev dependency.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,690
A lot of projects due the popularity of TypeScript will automatically install those for us.

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,340
In fact, if we go into our package dot JSON, we will see that we already have a couple of these types

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,790
files.

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,090
And the reason for this is because when we included Create React Out, it installed a lot of these typescript

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,230
files for us by default.

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,200
So all we need to do in order to get rid of this error is yarn add at types.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,570
Slash redux lager.

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:42,320
And now once TypeScript has finished resolving this, we can now just rerun our nullified dev just to

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,820
make sure that everything is working.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
And now that we've saved this and we go back.

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,490
There we go.

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,980
We see that the issue has gone away.

25
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,450
If we go back into our starts, we also see that Redux Lager has also been resolved.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,240
And that's it.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,510
If you ever encounter any of these type issues again, most likely just look inside the docs for that

28
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,400
specific third party library.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,710
Chances are there is a correlated TypeScript module for that library that you need to install.

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,310
So that's just one additional thing about TypeScript migrations that you've got to keep in mind.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,830
I'll see you in the next video.
