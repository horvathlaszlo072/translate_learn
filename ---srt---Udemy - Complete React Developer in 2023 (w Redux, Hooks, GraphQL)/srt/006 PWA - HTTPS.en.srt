00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:02,830
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,820
In this video, we're going to talk about this first point https and why we need it for progressive

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,460
Web apps now, progressive web apps.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,900
Have a certain checklist you can check out on the progressive web app checklist, and I know I know

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,020
I said that there isn't a checklist.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,600
Think of it.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,300
Think of progressive Web apps as a running list.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,370
But that's because these are probably going to get constantly updated and changed.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,670
Now, this checklist, as you go through it does look a little bit overwhelming.

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,780
But we've been following good practices while building our apps, just like we did with robo friends

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,840
out, and you've actually done most of these things.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,660
So that's why instead of showing you this.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:01:01,880
We only really need to focus on three main things that a progressive Web app needs to do now besides

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,280
these, there's a few features, but the adoption for them, such as push notifications, haven't been

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,900
that smooth or are still in the works.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,590
So for now, we're going to focus on things that you can implement right now fully and be confident

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,150
that they're going to work in your app.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:32,310
So https https, as you know, since we mentioned it a little bit in the SSA section, prevents bad

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,370
actors from tampering with communications between our app and browser.

20
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:47,270
So that if we're sending, let's say, a username and password to our server, we can encrypt it so

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:55,040
that that message that includes our password travels to the server in an encrypted fashion so that if

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,680
Bob, the evil third party hacker, is trying to intercept the messages and read them, even if he intercepts

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,350
the message, he won't understand it because it's encrypted.

24
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,060
And again, this is something that we talked about in my previous course.

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,270
Now, Google is really pushing for this https encryption.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,670
And if we go back to our websites.

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,060
We see that we have this little nice lock icon with secure.

28
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,100
That's a good sign.

29
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,750
Chrome has actually updated so that if you have any sort of forms on your website and they're not https,

30
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,040
it'll show up here as not secure, pretty much shaming websites for not using GPS.

31
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,620
So any time you're sending data from the client to the server, you should be using https.

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,220
Now, why do we need that, though, for progressive Web apps?

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,400
And that is because progressive Web apps use some features that we're going to talk about in other videos

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,380
that require https for security reasons.

35
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,180
Although this is a requirement for progressive web app in general, you should always serve your websites

36
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,890
if there's any sort of communication with the server through https.

37
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,110
And if we go to our lighthouse report, you see that when we scroll to progressive Web app and we check

38
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:30,340
out the nine past audits that we had, we have uses https as one of the requirements.

39
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,700
But how did that happen?

40
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,420
How do we have a GPS already?

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,520
And luckily for us, we get this out of the box with GitHub pages.

42
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,200
You can see over here that this link that was generated is a.

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,630
So any time you put a website on GitHub pages, we automatically get this encryption, which is fantastic.

44
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,020
But.

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,140
Not all websites can be hosted on GitHub pages.

46
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,490
You probably want to have your own server, your own domain name.

47
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:10,020
Well, the easiest way to get https is probably through, let's encrypt.

48
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:19,330
Let's encrypt is a free and it says over here it's a free, automated and open certificate authority

49
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:27,560
and they're fantastic to use and a certificate authority is just this authority that says, I'll give

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,590
you a certificate to certify that.

51
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,540
Yes, you are indeed.

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,880
Whoever you say you are, whatever your domain name is, and let's encrypt gives you free certificates.

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,050
That is really, really easy to set up.

54
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,210
And they have great documentation for you to use.

55
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,030
I highly recommend them.

56
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:54,370
You also have something like CloudFlare and Carfare is a CDN or a content delivery network, which we're

57
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,130
going to talk about in later sections.

58
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,880
But for now, you can think of them as a server that you can put your files on in just like GitHub pages

59
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,700
that hosts your files on their servers.

60
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,740
CloudFlare hosts your site on their pages.

61
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:20,390
And automatically through them, you get a GPS and if you go to their pricing, they're actually very,

62
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,690
very generous and there's a free plan for personal blog posts and any simple websites that you have.

63
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,150
Again, I highly recommend them.

64
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,050
And they actually do improve your performance of the website as well.

65
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,300
Again, something that we'll get into in the performance Part three section going back to our website.

66
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,170
This is something that we get out of the box.

67
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,690
Our app is going to work with all the other features of progressive web app because it's on GitHub pages

68
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:59,710
and we automatically get this awesome and we can double check over here with Prepacked Hacker News that

69
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,300
yep, indeed they are using https as well.

70
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,950
All right, that's it for now.

71
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
I'll see in the next one, bye bye.
