00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,200
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,650
In this video, we are going to dive into modifying our button component by thinking about how we can

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,700
leverage style components in order for us to make our code a little bit more solid in other ways than

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,470
just the styling aspect.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,560
So what I'm going to do first is I am going to show you one of the patterns that emerges with style

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,580
components that you may not have used yet.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,210
So inside again, I'm going to convert button styles over to a GSX file.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,180
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to import in styled from styled components.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,980
And now what I'm going to do is when thinking about buttons.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,240
We know that generally speaking, the button has some base styles and then depending on the class of

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,720
either Google sign in or inverted or potentially any future additional styling, as we add, they just

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,760
modify some of these values.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,890
But they do inherit a large portion of the base styles for this button.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:10,290
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create a new base button component, and this is going

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,600
to be a styled button component that has all of the base styles here for what we had before on our button

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,200
container.

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,530
So now this bass button is the normal button without any of the additional classes on it.

18
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:35,950
What we can do for another button, let's call it our Google sign in button is we can actually extend

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,630
on the base button the same way that we were doing it with that link component.

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,610
So I mentioned before you can take any component and add additional styling on top of it.

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,520
And because our base button is just the button, we can now say, Hey, this new component extends upon

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,840
the base button, these additional stylings that are unique to just the actual Google button.

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,000
And similarly, we want to do the same thing for the inverted styles.

24
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,100
So here what I'm going to do.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,540
I'm just going to copy this over.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:17,350
And once again, I want to duplicate this button with a new inverted button, which is equal to styled

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,550
on base button.

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,610
And inside, I'm going to paste my inverted styling.

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,900
And then just delete this now.

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,240
So now we have three types of buttons inverted Google sign in and the base button.

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:43,160
Well, we wanted to do inside of our button component is modify and impart the correct style components

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,400
now.

33
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,450
So I want to import in from button styles.

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,260
I'm going to bring in the base button.

35
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm going to bring in the Google sign in button.

36
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,090
And I'm also going to bring in the inverted button.

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,660
So now that I have these three buttons, what we had before was this button type classes object.

38
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,470
However, we didn't really get to leverage it as well as we want it to.

39
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Now what I mean by this is that when you think about this button type.

40
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:22,100
This button type allows us to not have to pass strings, instead, we can directly just use this object,

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,150
which allows us to leverage auto complete auto complete anywhere.

42
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,270
Just means that if you typed button type classes don't, you actually will automatically see that there

43
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,450
is Google an inverted as options that you can choose.

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,600
This makes it a lot easier for us to import in button type classes any time we want to figure out,

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,460
Hey, what are those different button types that render different styles of buttons?

46
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,920
You can just use this object instead of trying to figure out by typing in a string and then coming to

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,090
this component and checking.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,980
I'll show you what I mean once we finish writing this out.

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:03,560
So in order for us to leverage this now, what I can do is I can create a new function called Get Button,

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,230
and what get button should do is it should take the button type string and it should return us back

51
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,910
one of these three button components because remember, these are individual components now.

52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,000
So what I'm going to do is say, Hey, I'm going to get back a button type, and by default, I want

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,910
there to be a base button because the base button is what's going to push to this base button component.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,420
So by default, I'm going to say there is a base.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,080
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, OK, the button types default value, if none is past

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,570
is button type classes dot base.

57
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,540
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to return back from a special map object and this map object

58
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,060
is going to be past the button type volume.

59
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,940
So we're essentially saying, Hey, what I want is off of this button type, return me the specific

60
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,230
component that I want and the specific components are going to be mapped here.

61
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,380
So first, there's a button type classes like this dot base.

62
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,010
If I get base, then I want to return the base button.

63
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,910
So here we just want to return the literal functional component right now.

64
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,440
Similarly, I'm going to repeat this three times for the other types.

65
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,110
If there's Google, then what I want to return is the Google sign in button.

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,630
And finally, if there is inverted.

67
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,700
Then I want to return back the inverted button.

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,310
And now I'm going to save this.

69
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,150
And what you can do now is we can take this get button and come into our button component, and what

70
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,140
we'll say is that the actual button that we need to render.

71
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,630
So the custom button in this particular case is equal to calling get button and passing it the button

72
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:50,960
type.

73
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:01,140
Now what we do is that this component is now pointing to one of the three relevant buttons so we can

74
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,490
take this button and replace it with this current button right here.

75
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,940
Like so and now we don't need these class names anymore.

76
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,180
All of the other props we still want to spread through.

77
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,730
But now what we can do is leverage this button type class anywhere we're using the button.

78
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,500
So let me show you.

79
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,340
First, let's go into our sign in form component here, we're using a Google button.

80
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,110
So in order for us to leverage it, we want to say, Hey, take in the button.

81
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,460
Classes.

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,970
And we're going to come down here.

83
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,160
And what we can say is instead of button tape pointing to the string Google, which we can make a mistake

84
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,650
on, what we can do now is we can render button type classes dot Google.

85
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:58,570
And now if we save this, if we come back to our application and let's sign out and then go to our signing

86
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,110
page, we see that we still have our Google button.

87
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,930
Similarly, now let's go to our actual product form, which is where we show our other button type.

88
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,510
Here we use inverted.

89
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:22,420
So now if I import in button type classes and instead of button type again, I pass in button Typekit

90
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,050
inverted.

91
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,140
If I save this, I come back here.

92
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,610
I go to the shop.

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,080
There we see.

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,520
We have our inverted button.

95
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,650
But the main advantage of doing this style of pattern is that now we can really just leverage this object

96
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,800
that very easily tells us all the styles of buttons.

97
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,870
We don't have to guess for that string.

98
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,940
We don't have to mistyped that string.

99
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,010
These are all ways to eliminate the error of people, humans writing code.

100
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,070
And this is one of the big advantages, and it kind of actually gives us a little insight into a different

101
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,010
kind of pattern where it's very intuitive now for us to look at these different components and see them

102
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:10,180
as what kind of styling is relevant because we know, oh, there's based buttons, and then these similar

103
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,990
additional components are just additional styling on top of base buttons.

104
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:20,140
It's much more intuitive to look at components than it is to read giant walls of CSS and source code.

105
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,350
But this is the new pattern that we really can leverage now utilizing style components.

106
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,610
So now that we've learned these two main forms of using style components, we've done it with or navigation

107
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,690
and we've done it with the button.

108
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:40,420
My challenge to you is to convert the rest of the application over to style components.

109
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,610
So once you've done that.

110
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,370
Joining me in the next video where we will discuss perhaps some of the more challenging style components

111
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,770
that I found to be ones to convert.

112
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,280
There's a lot to go through if you want to compare ahead of time.

113
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm going to post a repo link inside of your resources folder that will show the entire application

114
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,720
migrated over to style components.

115
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,090
If not, join me in the next video or discuss some of the ones that I find a little bit more challenging

116
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,720
to think about.

117
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,190
I'll see you in the next video.
