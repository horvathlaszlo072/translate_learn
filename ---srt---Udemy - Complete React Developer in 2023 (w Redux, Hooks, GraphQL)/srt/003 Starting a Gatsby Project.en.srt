00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,040
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:09,850
So in the last lesson we learned about what it is that Gatsby does at a high level now in this lesson,

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,250
let's actually take a look at what we're going to build.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,870
So what you'll end up building is just this basic blog website.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,040
In this lesson, there's not that much styling to it, because what I'm trying to show you is just the

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,320
basic concepts in Gatsby in order to get you up and running.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,750
Now, how you end up actually styling your blog or adding features to your blog is entirely up to you

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,160
and definitely part of the coding challenge.

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,330
Now, the blog itself is very simple.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:47,550
It simply has a list of all of our blog posts that you can navigate to and navigate back from.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:55,600
But the main thing to keep in mind here is that a lot of this content is actually dynamically generated

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,250
inside of Gatsby.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,690
I'll show you what I mean.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,860
It's actually really interesting because Gatsby style of setting up this blog is different from how

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,680
you would typically write it in a react application because of a lot of the plugins and APIs inside

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,400
of Gatsby in how it generates this static website.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,690
Now, we're also going to learn how to host our blog on Nat Lafi.

18
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:27,550
So Nat Lafi is a company that offers this amazing back and service for you to host static websites.

19
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,260
And the free tier of net lafi is extremely generous.

20
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,700
It's way more than what we need for our blog.

21
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,830
And it's incredibly easy.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,740
It actually gives us continuous deployment pretty much right out the gate with GitHub.

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,520
And what that means is that we're able to push our code to GitHub connected to Net Lafi, and whenever

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:56,470
we push code to that GitHub repo net, Lafi will automatically redeploy and rebuild our website and

25
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,440
update r u r l with our latest code.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,550
So that's a really, really great service that we can leverage while using Gatsby because we're building

27
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,810
static websites.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,620
So now that we know what we're building and where we're going to host it to, let's actually take a

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,060
look at how to write this code.

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,690
So let's go to our terminal and what we're going to leverage is The Gatsby, Seelie.

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:31,050
So Seelie is a command line interface, which is a tool that we can use to quickly set up and build

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,120
Gatsby projects pretty much just like create react in order to use it.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,020
We're going to leverage aspects which, as you remember, is a new feature that comes with a later version

34
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,930
of NPM that allows us to leverage packages without having to download them globally on our computer.

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,930
So using NPCs, I'm going to say Gatsby New and then Gatsby blog.

36
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:08,160
So what this does is it will initialise and Klown down using the Gadsby starter, a new Gatsby project

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,500
for me.

38
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,290
Now, there's actually a lot of other starter projects you're able to leverage.

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,160
And all you would do is after seeing Gatsby blog or whatever name you want for your gas project, you

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,170
say space and then you link the new star that you want to actually leverage.

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,370
And Gatsby provides all these starters, depending on what kind of website you're looking to build.

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:38,490
In fact, there's even a Gatsby blog starter that Dan Abramov, the creator of Redox and a very, very

43
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,490
prominent member of the reactor core team, uses to create his new blog, overreacted.

44
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,130
Now, you can totally take a look at this afterwards, but let's just get started first to understand

45
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,820
all of the nuances in using Gatsby.

46
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,890
So once we've actually created our New Gatsby blog repo, let's see into it.

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,670
And let's just open up the code and see what we have.

48
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:16,160
Now, you'll see right away that our folder structure comes with these different files here inside of

49
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,220
the source folder.

50
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,620
We have something that we might be used to seeing with our REACT projects, which is a components folder.

51
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,310
We have an images folder that holds some images and we have these pages folder.

52
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,600
Now we're going to talk about the pages folder.

53
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,600
But first, let's just take a look at these four files we have here.

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,830
The Gatsby browser dodges The Gatsby config, Duchesse Gatsby No Duchesse and Gatsby Ezat.

55
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,330
So you can actually get server side rendering with Gatsby if you follow some of the instructions with

56
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,910
the gas BSR API dock.

57
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,890
Now, we're not actually going to do that in this course, but it's nice to know that you can achieve

58
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,760
it with Gatsby.

59
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,220
So if you're curious to see how to implement it after this course, you can definitely take a look at

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,850
these docs.

61
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,010
Gatsby Noad we're going to use in order to build out some of the more server required, things that

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,060
we will definitely explore in this course.

63
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,050
So for now, just understand that this is where we end up writing some of our node related code.

64
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:29,430
Now, The Gatsby config is actually the main file that we're going to focus on inside of this lesson,

65
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:37,020
at the very least, that Gatsby config holds a lot of the configuration options that we need in order

66
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,740
for Gatsby to know what to do.

67
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:46,590
Now, this site metadata is actually data that we can pull into our components using Graph QR inside

68
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,010
of Our Gatsby project.

69
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,140
So if we wanted access to a title, this description or the author in any way, we are able to leverage

70
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,870
graph and pull this site metadata right out of this Kaspi config object.

71
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:09,090
These plug ins are additional little libraries in Gatsby that allow you to do different things with

72
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,270
different files.

73
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,890
So we'll definitely explore this later.

74
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,050
But you can see these as kind of additional helper libraries that transform the way that we're able

75
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,270
to use Gatsby.

76
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,030
And we'll take a better look at this in a later lesson.

77
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:31,290
For now, just understand that this plugins array is where we would add any new plugins that we want

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,160
for Our Gatsby project.

79
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:41,790
Now, Gatsby does have a lot of configuration and a lot of plug ins, so you can definitely take some

80
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,660
time and read a lot of the documentation that's available for many of the plugins that come by default

81
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,490
with the starter.

82
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,750
There's also going to be a lot of Gatsby concepts that we're going to cover.

83
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:03,270
And honestly, you kind of have to just follow through with this lesson in order to understand at the

84
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,930
end how all of these pieces come together because there are so many moving parts in order for us to

85
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,480
end up building our blog.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,960
But Gatsby does try and make it as easy as possible.

87
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:22,530
So as we build out some of these features, we're going to go back to a lot of these files to better

88
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,940
understand what they're for.

89
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,870
Right now.

90
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,730
I just want to introduce you to the base files so that we understand what we're doing.

91
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Now, one of the big things is actually to look at a package that Jason and looking at the scripts we

92
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,920
see that it does provide us with quite a few.

93
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,360
Now, the main one that we want is actually Gatsby develop because Gatsby develop is what we use in

94
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,820
order to serve up our website on localhost.

95
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,680
So let's actually just test that first.

96
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,610
So what we'll do is just run, npm, run, develop.

97
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,640
And what this will do is it will build up our New Gatsby application and it'll actually give us two

98
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,180
routes.

99
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,960
The first one will be localhost eight thousand.

100
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,340
That is going to host the actual website.

101
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,920
The second you are, all they're going to give us is localhost eight thousand, underscore, underscore,

102
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,330
underscore, craft, QOL.

103
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,990
And this is going to be a graphical playground.

104
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,640
But we'll look at that in the next lesson in this lesson.

105
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,230
Let's just navigate to localhost a thousand in order to see what it is that we get.

106
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:39,620
So by default, we get this Gatsby default page and we see that there's some routing that's set up for

107
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,650
us, so we load this little astronaut and if we go to page, it takes us to a different page at this

108
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,900
route and we can go back to our home page.

109
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,150
Really simple, really quick.

110
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,330
They've just set up something here for us to just build off of.

111
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,740
So now that we see this in the next lesson, let's take a look at how the code actually translates to

112
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,660
what we see here.

113
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,740
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
