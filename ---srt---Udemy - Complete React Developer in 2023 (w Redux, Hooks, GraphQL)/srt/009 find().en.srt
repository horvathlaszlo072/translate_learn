1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,670
Now, before we do reduce, let's do find so what is find?

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:17,390
Well, let's first get our array again, so we'll just copy over what we had from our last experiment.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:29,060
And find is also exactly as it sounds, we're trying to find an element that correctly returns true

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,120
based on the condition that we have.

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:41,890
And the return of our function, very similar to filter, so what we would say is Meyera Dot find.

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:52,820
And we would get our element and let's say I wanted the element that is equal to five well here at what

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,650
would get us our element five, right?

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,720
Because if one goes in, is it equal to five?

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,470
No, three, no.

10
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,420
But five is true.

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,260
And the moment that it's correct, this method actually stops and it gives us back the first value in

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:18,080
the array that return true from calling this function on each element so it won't keep going.

13
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:26,590
So a way we can actually see this is if we say Meyera, fine and we get our aliment.

14
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,170
And let's say we do, as long as the element is greater than four.

15
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:42,220
So theoretically, five, seven and nine are all true, but because it's applying it from left to right

16
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:49,390
on each element, the first element that this returns true, it will return and it won't keep going.

17
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,750
And we know that it will be five.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:01,100
So don't find is a great way for us when world, let's say we have an array of objects, right.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,080
And we want to find a specific object based on some condition.

20
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,840
Right.

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:16,370
You can imagine if we had let's say people are right where we had an array of objects where the I.D.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,150
was one.

23
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,700
The I.D. of four.

24
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,580
And then the idea of seven.

25
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:37,740
If we wanted to find people Arae right, with the idea for one, then we would say person or person

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,770
thought it was equal to four.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,890
And now this will give us our second item where it's our person with our idea for.

28
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,080
So this is the great thing about find is that final give us the reference to whatever element it is

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,360
that matches the condition that we pass in the function of our find.

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,610
And we will use this as well quite extensively in our coding.
