00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,350
In this video, we are going to clean up the last few remaining things inside of our website.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,420
The first thing is we're going to remove this console.log of our categories map from our categories

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,940
context and then the next thing is to make it so that these fronts and directory items linked to the

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,190
appropriate pages now that we have them.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,660
So let's go back into our application to get rid of the console.log.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,660
Very simply, we didn't just remove Line 15 inside of the use effect of our categories context.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,880
As for actually fixing the routing here inside of our categories, we have this categories object that

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,970
currently lives in the home and passes it to the directory.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,990
What we can do, in fact, is move this somewhere else and modify it so that our home page doesn't do

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,850
any of this prop drilling now that we've learned a little bit more because we set up the directory really

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,240
early.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,190
So let's move this out of directories come into the directories and now instead of ingesting categories

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,730
like so.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,320
We can actually just move the categories into this component.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,040
In fact, let's move it above because it's pretty much a constant.

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,370
Now, similarly, as I mentioned before, there are different ways we could tackle this.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:24,470
We can attach this onto our collection inside a fire store with the category itself if you want to do

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,130
it that way.

20
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,200
The main reason why I'm doing it here is because we need something like a root name or a root.

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:36,290
More specifically, because this is going to tell our directory item where it needs to go, which is

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,540
kind of exclusive to the application.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,010
Making it so that it's on the back end makes no sense.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,820
If you have other applications that consume these categories, that property might not apply to them.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
It only applies to our friends in application.

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,310
So really, we can attach the rule ourselves here.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,380
And the route we need to go to is specifically shop slash hats.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,260
This is for our hats.

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,630
For jackets, of course, it's shop slash jackets for sneakers.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,040
It's shop slash sneakers.

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,830
For women's, it's shops, women's and then for men's, it's shop slash men's.

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,660
So now when we pass this category into our directory item.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,910
Inside of the directory item, we also want a D structure off the root.

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,210
And in order to use the route, we can either transform our directory item container into a link component,

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,240
or I can show you another programmatic way to do it by using a hook that we get from react.

36
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,620
Router up.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,310
And this is the use navigate, hook with use, navigate, it actually gives us a function called navigate.

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,090
Or whatever you want to call it.

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,900
I'm going to call it navigate, which we get back from, call it use, navigate.

40
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,970
Navigate is essentially a way for us to route, so we can say on.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,200
Navigate Handler.

42
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,860
Which is equal to a function that calls navigate and then we give it the right.

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,620
Oh, I'm missing accounts.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,030
There we go.

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,360
So now if we just pass this to the on click.

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,300
Of the directory item container.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
If we come back now.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,340
Anywhere we click.

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,310
It will take us to the appropriate place.

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,180
So there we go.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,760
Our application is pretty much finished being built in the next video.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,770
I'm going to show you where we're going to host this, and it's a great place that's really easy and

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,670
really quick, and we'll have our website up in less than five minutes.

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,470
So join me in the next video or we will finally host this application that we fully built.

55
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,970
I'll see you in the next video.
