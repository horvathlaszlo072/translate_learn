1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,750
All right, all right, I had to make this quick video to talk about the elephant in the room, if you

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,820
know anything about the react world.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,630
Well, this discussion has to happen.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,730
Classes versus Hooke's.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,770
Now, as you learn in the course, there's many ways to build react components and one of the newer

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,340
ways to write these components is using Hooke's.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, the way we've structured the course is the way that we actually recommend you learn how to write

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,160
proper applications.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,770
The thing is, Hooke's are fairly new and they're exciting.

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,160
So a lot of people talk about them, but they're also very specific to react.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,610
What you learn about Hooke's, you can't really apply to anywhere else and the programming world because

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,710
they're so react specific versus classes.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,980
Well, that's part of JavaScript.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,850
Learning classes is an important concept, not only in JavaScript, but a lot of other programming languages

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,700
also because Hooke's are fairly new.

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,970
A lot of code bases, in fact, still use classes because there's nothing wrong with classes.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,400
So the way we've structured the course is that we're going to teach you react starting with classes.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,750
So you know how those works so that you can apply that knowledge to any of your future projects.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,370
Or if you land on a project at a job that still uses classes.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,310
And then we're going to convert the app using hooks.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,590
So you get to learn both ways.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,670
And we also started with classes because there's been a little bit of move lately in the industry where

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,900
people are shying away from hooks because of the added complexity.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,580
It adds to react.

25
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,740
Now, this is a hot topic of discussion.

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,380
It doesn't really matter whichever one you prefer.

27
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,790
Our goal is to teach you both and then you can decide for yourself what is best.

28
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,640
The way we structure the course is what we think is the best way to learn, react.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,940
That is starting with classes as they were intended, and then learning hooks afterwards to show what

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,810
problems Hooke's solves that maybe we had with classes.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,160
So hang in there.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,420
We're going to cover both of these.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll see you in the next one.
