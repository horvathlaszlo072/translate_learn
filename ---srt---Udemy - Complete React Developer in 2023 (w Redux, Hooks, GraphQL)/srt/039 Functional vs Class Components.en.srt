00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,880
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,670
In the next few videos, we are going to learn about functional components and how to write our application

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,670
using functional components in place of class components.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,510
I want to mention that functional components utilize hooks in order to replicate a very similar behavior,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,550
as we see with class components.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,290
The key thing is that they differ in how React utilizes them in order to render the behavior in the

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,410
application is the exact same, and the way you write these components is largely the exact same.

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,160
You just have to change their understanding of how these components operate.

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,390
And I know right now it seems a little vague, but don't worry too much about the implementation yet.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,950
We're going to spend a lot of time with that.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,770
I really want you to understand the high level concept here, because this will really help you understand

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,490
why React has functional components as well as class components.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,240
React is a library that has been around for a long time.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,890
It's important to note that because of this, react is constantly changing in this change, it's constantly

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,900
trying to support multiple businesses that utilize it in order to build their web applications.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,550
This means that these businesses also have a very diverse pool of developers.

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,290
Some are comfortable writing classes, some are comfortable with functional programming, which is writing

18
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,810
in the majority of your code as functions.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,900
And as a result, React largely does cater to both different developer pools.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,890
Similarly, throughout reax development history, it has tried to keep up with the trend of larger developer

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,770
practices versus lesser developer practices, and it's constantly trying to balance these things as

22
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,240
far as you need to be concerned.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,820
It's important for you to know class and functional components because different companies will, right

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,990
react differently.

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,390
Some will write them and functional components with hooks.

26
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,550
Some will write them in class components.

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,650
Most will write them in a mix.

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,810
There may be a larger push towards functional components as you join newer startups.

29
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,340
But that does not mean that larger enterprises do not run class components.

30
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,830
So it's very important that, you know both so that you're able to effectively write react regardless

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,450
of the team you join in.

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,270
A similar fashion class components is a very important starting point for learning react because React

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,150
was founded on the concept of class components.

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,810
It was probably the first way that you could write components in the very beginning.

35
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:30,470
So the majority of how React determined the base point of how it thought about rendering inside of a

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,140
web application was based on classes.

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,720
And as a result, by understanding how React decides when to render and render, we're able to just

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,870
have a better foundation of understanding that concept so that when we move over to functional components,

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
we already understand how rendering re rendering operates.

40
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,640
Then it's just a matter of changing the model to a different form of component.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,460
And we're definitely going to dive deep into all of that.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,880
So don't even worry you're going to become a whiz in no time.

43
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,880
I do want to note that in the upcoming videos, we will start diving deeper into functional components.

44
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,280
But in your capstone project, which will be the project that we work on after we finish this section,

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,830
I will start flip flopping between functional components and class components.

46
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:23,660
The reason for that is because it requires us, in my opinion, to have a good foundation of both to

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,240
really understand functional components.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,350
Functional components is easier learned in some ways.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,080
Once you have a foundation of class components, but it is important to note that they are two different

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
styles of writing components.

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,470
It seems really vague right now, but again you will understand why.

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,000
I just want you to prepare yourself to see that we will be using both class and functional components,

53
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,500
and throughout this course, I will be answering when you should use one over the other.

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,300
But generally speaking, most of the time you can use either or it's really just up to the team that

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,860
you join and what the general coding patterns are within that team.

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,470
Sometimes it will be functional, sometimes it will be class.

57
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,240
Sometimes they might not care.

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
It really depends from organization to organization.

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,420
Therefore, for you to be the most effective React developer you can be, you should learn both and

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,410
understand both.

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,980
So with that noted, let's move on to functional components.
