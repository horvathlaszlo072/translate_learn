1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,200
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,290
Now that we understand how Create wrapped up has helped us scaffold out our project, let's actually

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,210
go about building our project.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,790
There's a couple of things that I want you to really focus in on while we go through these lessons,

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,470
especially throughout this course, because I think that this is probably the main thing you want to

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,780
focus on when it comes to learning react as a concept beyond just learning how to actually write the

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,060
code that React presents itself with.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,780
And this concept is the idea of rendering, in my opinion, what makes a great react developer from

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,120
a good react developer is a great react.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,210
Developer really understands when React is rendering and re rendering your website.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,480
This is one of the most core and essential things to understand with React, because that's really all

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,320
reacts.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,640
Earlier, Andre mentioned that when we're writing React, we are going to write things in either class

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,090
components or functional components with hooks.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,240
Functional components with hooks is the modern way that we do a lot of things and react, even though

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
many companies use a mix of classes and functional components.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,690
And if this doesn't make sense right now, don't worry about it.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,490
The reason why you don't need to worry about it is because it's really just syntax and different ways

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:26,460
to do kind of the same thing, which is tell react when you want it to render and re render different

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,220
parts of your website.

21
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,350
And I'm really going to hone in on this throughout this course.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:39,180
But this is what I really want you to focus on is understanding when React renders and Re renders parts

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,460
of your website because that's really all React does as a framework.

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,190
So in order for us to begin on this, let's first take a look at our project.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,980
So as I mentioned in our package, Jason Create React app gave us this start script that lets us start

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,260
the base project that it scaffold it for us.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,230
So in case you haven't done it again, let's just quickly do it.

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,360
Let's go back to our terminal and let's run yarn start, which is the script that will start up our

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,030
React server that will then host our website.

30
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,120
So here we're going to local host 3000, which is where our website is going to be hosted.

31
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,130
So let's just wait for this to load.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
And now we see it.

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,160
This is the base project that create racked up has given us.

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,240
So what you saw here is that this website was loading and waiting for react to render something onto

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,780
the page.

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,760
In this case, we have this spinning logo, we have this text and then we have this link to learn more

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,510
about React.

38
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,760
It links to the React box, but what happened here was that this page was rendered.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,850
These different things that you see were all rendered.

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,940
All you need to understand about rendering is pretty much putting some UI, which is some HTML, some

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,360
CSS or some JavaScript on to the page that a user can then interact with and see.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,520
So something is done rendering the moment that they can interact with it, it's on the page.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,890
That's the idea of rendering.

44
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,120
So let's go back to our code here and let's go into APKs.

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,120
As I mentioned, when we were walking through a Create React app, it generated this file for us app

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,050
G.S. and inside is a function app, and this function returns some HTML when you look at this.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,950
The reason why you can read this as HTML and JavaScript is able to render this is because of the fact

48
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,440
that this is written in J.S. X.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,680
So GSX is really just a syntax extension of JavaScript.

50
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,960
Now you might be wondering what syntax extension?

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,680
What does that mean?

52
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,000
All it really means is that they've taken JavaScript and they've added more functionality to it.

53
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,420
They've extended its functionality.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,650
And what it really works is that it allows you to write what looks like HTML inside of your JavaScript.

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,190
So this looks like HTML, but it's not HTML, but it really closely resembles HTML, and that's really

56
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,360
the most important thing.

57
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,680
The reason why is because React decided that a lot of what you want to render visually now.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,490
The visual representation, of course, is HTML as we know them and captures what we want to put onto

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,180
the web page.

60
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,210
It doesn't actually extend any of the functionality.

61
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,390
Remember, the functionality is the JavaScript.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,140
The behavior is the JavaScript.

63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,570
The email just determines what you want to see.

64
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,500
React is decided that that thing that you want to see the UI component is very closely tied to how you

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,090
want the UI to behave.

66
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,770
So we'll learn a lot more about that throughout the course, and you'll really understand that idea.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,570
But what you really want to focus on here with Jeff Sachs is that it makes it much easier for us to

68
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:57,910
tell our JavaScript code, i.e. our function what we want it to visually render to the page.

69
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:06,160
GSX is really just a more efficient way for us to tell our React code or our JavaScript extended code.

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:14,560
What we want to render in this particular case, this function app is a functional component that renders

71
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,450
through its written statement.

72
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,730
This block of HTML or HTML like JavaScript.

73
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,580
So we'll dive into this a lot more.

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,690
But again, what I want you to focus on is that this has to do with the rendering.

75
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,680
We're telling this function what we want it to render, and the GSX just makes it easier for us to tell

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,940
this functional app what we want it to render.

77
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,220
So writing a functional component is one way to render something to the page.

78
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,160
That's the only way to telling ract what our component should do.

79
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,610
Another way, though, is using a class component and a class component is where I want us to start.

80
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,510
As I mentioned before, class components do pretty much the same thing.

81
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,330
Functional components do just in a slightly different way.

82
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,770
But they all do the same thing.

83
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,820
Functional components and class components allows us to tell react what we expect this component to

84
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,490
render and how we expect it to render things.

85
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,040
And I want to start with a class component over a functional component because a class component is

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,570
easier to understand.

87
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,810
This idea of when react will render and render things.

88
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,340
And I'm going to show you how.

89
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,680
So what we're going to first do is just convert this into a class component.

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,330
In order to do that, we actually need to import component from React.

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,760
And this is something that is a class that really gives us so that it allows all of the new components

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,150
that we write in a class component format to get access to some of the functionality that by default,

93
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,460
reactor's already built for us inside of this component class.

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,770
So let's convert it.

95
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,870
I'm going to say class app.

96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,250
Extends component.

97
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,310
So here I'm saying, hey, I want you to make this class called app and I want you to extend the functionality

98
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,250
of this component class that React has given us.

99
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:19,590
And what we need to change here is that React has also created on this component Class A render method.

100
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,700
So this already exists.

101
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:30,000
But what we're passing to it is this return and inside of this return is going to be again the G6 or

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,170
HMO representation of what you want this component to give back.

103
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,220
And that's it.

104
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,740
This will pretty much be the exact same thing as that previous app function that we had.

105
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,280
So if we go back to our browser, we'll see that our web page is the exact same.

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,340
Everything is still working if we open up our console.

107
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,940
We see that we have no errors.

108
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,650
So here we understand, OK, this functional components that we had before is pretty much the exact

109
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,020
same now as this class component.

110
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
They're still rendering the same thing.

111
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:14,020
In fact, it's just that here React is explicitly telling us, Oh, this is what you are rendering.

112
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,530
So that is why I think it's more helpful already we already seeing, Oh, I'm already explicitly telling

113
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,480
my component what I wanted to render, and therefore React knows, oh what I want to render whatever

114
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,240
is returned from my render method.

115
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,910
So in this lesson, we learned that there are functional components and class components that both pretty

116
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,630
much just tell.

117
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,880
React that with this component.

118
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,980
What do I want you to render?

119
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,260
In the next video, we're going to learn about some additional things that we can do that we can jump

120
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,840
in and modify both what we're rendering and how we want things to be re rendered.

121
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,780
And that will really help us be able to actually begin to modify our website to be more like an app.

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,980
And we're going to see that in the next video.

123
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,140
So I'll see you there.
