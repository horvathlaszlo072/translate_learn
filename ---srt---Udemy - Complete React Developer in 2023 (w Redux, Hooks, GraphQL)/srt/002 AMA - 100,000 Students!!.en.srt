1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,880
Hey there, it's is my face.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm usually sitting in front of a computer, not in front of a camera, which I'm not comfortable with,

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:21,840
but this is the Army video, and I want to just absolutely thank all of you because we have officially

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,940
had one hundred thousand unique students, which is insane.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,330
Absolutely mind blowing.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,670
I did an AMA video when we hit a thousand students and I thought that was just extraordinary.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,080
And to be at one hundred thousand now is absolutely incredible.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
I feel extremely lucky.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,890
I feel extremely blessed.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,480
And not to get too sappy here, but I'm very, very thankful for you watching this video right now because

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,400
I don't really do any marketing.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,920
And it's it's all grown out of word of mouth.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,930
So thank you for telling your friends, your family, your kids, whatever it is.

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,770
I am extremely thankful that I get to do what I do.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,090
And it's all because of you.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,740
All right.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,980
So no more sappiness.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,930
Let's get to it.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,600
I asked you on Dischord some questions that you might have for me.

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,850
There were a lot of questions.

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,620
Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer all of them.

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,410
I don't want to make this into a boring one hour video.

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,760
So I pick the ones that I thought had a lot of people interested in them.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,080
And hopefully I can give you some some answers.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,930
Keep in mind that you should form your own opinions and decisions based on this.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,980
This is just one person's view.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,670
My view.

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,560
It doesn't mean that I'm 100 percent correct.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,710
If I thought that, then I would have a YouTube channel.

30
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,470
But take it with a grain of salt.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,850
These are just my opinions.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,200
I may be wrong.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,320
I may be right is just what has worked in my life doesn't necessarily mean that it will work for you

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,820
or the answers are right for you.

35
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,620
All right.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:01,140
The first one here, we have Nick Salaat who asks, what's the best way to get into machine learning

37
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,790
and artificial intelligence?

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,580
That's actually a question that kept coming up.

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,640
A lot of people are interested in machine learning, data science, anything related to A because it

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,490
is extremely popular and a hot topic right now.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,240
I actually have a course coming up on it that that tries to tackle that question because machine learning

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,720
right now, it's a bit of a buzzword where it it solves all your business problems when in fact, maybe

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
it's not necessarily so.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,380
And I think there's developer interest to learn about machine learning, as well as business analysts

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:41,070
and business decision makers to use machine learning and data to improve their profits and their business.

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,460
So I don't really give you an answer for that one, but it's one of those topics that I think in order

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,180
to learn about it, you should at least learn to code be become a web developer force or perhaps have

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,550
some understanding of business data data analysis before you get into it.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,560
All right.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,380
Next, the next question is from N.K. Talk about your life as a developer from start until now to learn

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,770
from you.

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,550
Well, I think some of you know, from my previous anime, I did not come from a computer science background.

53
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,800
I came from a business background.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,900
I did also a minor in psychology and learned to code in my twenties.

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm thirty three now, by the way.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,870
Hopefully I don't look thirty three, but that's that's my age.

57
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,180
And yeah, I would break down the developer lifecycle into three phases.

58
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,710
So the first one is where you're just learning, you're learning to code.

59
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,150
Everything is completely new.

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,000
You feel extremely overwhelmed, overwhelmed.

61
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,820
You don't know what to learn, what person to trust, what mentor to have, what course to take.

62
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,890
That's a really big challenge.

63
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,710
And getting to the point of understanding and being able to build something from scratch yourself.

64
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,240
I think that's the first phase.

65
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,990
The second phase was when when I was employed for the first time and the first couple of years working

66
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:11,370
as a developer where you feel the imposter syndrome, where you feel like you just don't know enough,

67
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,590
or somehow they hired you by mistake.

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,890
And while everybody else around you is smarter than you, that phase really goes by.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,950
The one advice that I have for that phase is to honestly be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,350
That is, ask as many questions as you want.

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,230
Don't feel like you're raising your hand and asking question.

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,990
It's going to make you feel it's going to make others look at you like you're dumb or not good enough.

73
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,060
The more questions you ask, the better you'll have the answers and you'll find that the successful

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,540
people through this phase are the people who ask a ton of questions.

75
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,810
When they don't understand something, they try to learn and try to grab as much experience as possible

76
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,770
from those around you.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,100
And then the third phase is when you start to become a little bit of a senior developer, when you start

78
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,000
to get confident.

79
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,840
Your abilities, you perhaps start to lead projects, perhaps other junior developers look up to you

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,810
and ask you questions.

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:15,050
One of the biggest things with that face of a developer is to not almost get a God complex where you

82
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,370
feel like your opinions are the right ones and everybody else's is absolutely wrong.

83
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,610
I've seen way too many really good developers get overconfident in themselves and have really strong

84
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,830
opinions where they don't take anything else into consideration.

85
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,070
I think through that phase, if you're able to understand everything, it has pros and cons, everything

86
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,570
depends on the situation.

87
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,100
And that you're not only used graphics.

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,010
Oh, I only use typescript.

89
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:51,650
And dynamic languages are trash when you avoid those strong opinions to almost make yourself feel like

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,000
you're smart, you're doing something wrong there.

91
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,260
You want to be open to ideas, open to suggestions, and not forget to keep growing from that phase,

92
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,170
because as you start to get more and more recognition, maybe feel more confident, it's very easy to

93
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,990
think that you've reached the pinnacle and you need to stop learning.

94
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,100
This whole industry is all about learning and constantly evolving.

95
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,290
And what, you know, two years from now will probably be different than what you know.

96
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,840
So those are the three phases, kind of the ones that I went through.

97
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,090
Obviously, I'm teaching now, but for me, learning doesn't stop.

98
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm constantly learning.

99
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm constantly trying to improve myself, both in teaching, but also as a developer.

100
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,240
And I hope that that is the case with you as well.

101
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:37,890
All right.

102
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,950
Next question.

103
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,200
Next question is from S.G. How many countries have you visited during the last year?

104
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,040
Any suggestions to travel while working remote?

105
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,750
So for some of you that don't know, I, I work completely remote.

106
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,690
I carry my recorded recording equipment online and I set up my studio wherever I am in the world.

107
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:04,730
So my courses have been recorded in in Ecuador, in Nicaragua, Colombia and Greece and Romania.

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,980
Pretty much anywhere that I'm traveling, I bring my recording equipment, set up my little studio and

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,870
and record.

110
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,210
So last year I traveled to, I would say, about seven or eight countries where I lived.

111
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:25,190
And then in then long term, my favorite was I actually recorded The Master, the coding interview course

112
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:33,200
in a little house on the side of a volcano in Ecuador, where the last house at the very top of the

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,920
volcano.

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:41,120
So we had to hike down and grab groceries every time we needed to eat or wanted to cook dinner and hike

115
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,770
back up with all our groceries.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,790
That was a lot of fun.

117
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,490
Any advice for remote?

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Honestly, if it's one of those lifestyles that it sounds nice, but it also requires a lot of dedication

119
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,850
and and commitment to to work instead of just not being committed to a schedule and making it really

120
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,900
easy to go off and pretend like you're busy without actually accomplishing anything.

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,760
So you do need to have a bit of structure.

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,670
But for those that are self-motivated and determined enough and can keep track of tasks and don't get

123
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,180
distracted, often, it's it's definitely a lot of fun.

124
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,730
All right.

125
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:26,630
This next question, I think I got asked maybe five times from people like Durjan, supah scrammed block,

126
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,890
all of them essentially said, why did you quit your full time job?

127
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,470
How come you're not a developer anymore?

128
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,960
Well, let's say that I'm still a developer.

129
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,570
I do a bit of consulting work on the side.

130
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,840
The reason that I quit my developer job was mainly because I wanted to I wanted to travel a little bit

131
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,860
and take a break.

132
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,100
I had spent a couple of years working for other people and working on projects that perhaps I didn't

133
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,210
care too much about.

134
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,020
I was working for other people's passion projects or businesses.

135
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,530
And after a while that that kind of gets old, or at least it did for me, where I found that I stopped

136
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,280
learning as much.

137
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,010
It was just repeating and doing the same thing over and over.

138
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,290
So I decided to quit and kind of figure out what what I want to do next.

139
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:18,920
And along the way, I decided to record some videos, my first course to mastery, to just keep myself

140
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:28,550
busy and keep doing something and and help people who were like me, where they didn't have a background

141
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,200
and wanted to get into web development, but there wasn't a clear path for them to do so.

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:42,020
So I recorded that course and it took off and all of a sudden this became my full time job and now I

143
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,320
would one hundred percent still go back to being a full time developer.

144
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
But I'm having so much fun teaching.

145
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,430
I still get to code every day.

146
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,890
I still get to learn every day.

147
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:59,450
And if anything, I think this way have a bigger impact on on people's lives than.

148
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,580
I did when I worked on a single project, so that's why I quit my job and at the end of the day, it

149
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,260
was one of the best decisions I ever made.

150
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,050
I have another question here, which is, what is my biggest regret?

151
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,500
I feel like I'm in an interview right now, so I'll give you my interview answer in case you ever get

152
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,610
asked this in an interview.

153
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,190
So my biggest regret, honestly, it's there's nothing I'm really, really happy that I learn coding

154
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,420
when I did in my 20s and not when I was young, because when I was young, I was able to learn different

155
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,810
skills.

156
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,860
I was able to learn about business, about about psychology, about communicating with others and people.

157
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,130
And those skills helped me get my first job as a developer, although maybe I started to code when I

158
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,900
was a lot later on in life.

159
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,780
It's not like I didn't do anything before my 20s.

160
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,190
I was learning different skills.

161
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,690
And for those people that perhaps are thinking, am I too old to learn to code?

162
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,250
Or I'm in my thirties and there's people, you know, in their teens that are learning to code right

163
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,920
now, there's no way that I'm going to be able to keep up, keep in mind that most likely have skill

164
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,390
sets that other people don't.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,290
And when it comes to regret, honestly, there's nothing.

166
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,480
As long as you're learning every single day and learning something useful over the years that's going

167
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,610
to compound.

168
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,680
And honestly, every single mistake, every single decision that you make leads you to to where you

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,500
are now, which sounds a little hokey pokey.

170
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,060
But but it is true, honestly, the there are no regrets if you're learning, you're never going to

171
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,110
have regrets in life.

172
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,250
All right.

173
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,760
I'm just gonna ask me, what annoyed you the most about being a developer?

174
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,710
I usually don't get annoyed.

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,090
I'm pretty easy going.

176
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:52,500
But the one thing that I did notice was that as people get more and more experienced, they tend to

177
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,600
form really strong opinions and everybody wants to feel like they're part of a group.

178
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,750
And I think we see that a lot on Twitter and YouTube and all these people, really strong opinions that

179
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,660
kind of gang up on other people that have different beliefs than them.

180
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,200
I think it's very easy in the developer community to have something like that where you're thinking,

181
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:20,190
my react team is better than your angular team or typescript and static typing is the way to go or rest

182
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,730
is dead.

183
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,000
And let's all use graphics.

184
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,470
Well, I think when you have that type of mentality, it's it's really, really hard to actually have

185
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:35,340
smart discussions and and and decisions within a project and becomes really, really easy for those

186
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,870
who feel superior to others and feel confident in their opinions to really impose their opinions on

187
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:49,440
others, especially junior developers that, you know, are susceptible and have less experience.

188
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,330
So they start to believe these senior developers that perhaps have really strong opinions.

189
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,180
And in turn, that kind of creates this wave of more and more people that think it's a good idea to

190
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,390
have strong opinions and debate with others and argue with others and and telling people that their

191
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,910
code stocks and their code is the right way of doing it.

192
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:19,410
I think that was a little bit annoying to deal with because because I think it influences junior developers

193
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,010
a lot.

194
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,340
And I don't think it's a good attitude to have when working with others.

195
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:31,380
I think being a being somebody senior, being a lead, being a project lead means you're a person that

196
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,410
doesn't put other people down, but it lifts others.

197
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:40,200
And that was a little bit annoying because I thought that I saw that that was a little bit prevalent

198
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,590
where everybody's trying to almost appease each other and be a better developer than though this person

199
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,690
and this person, instead of all of you growing together and learning together because there's enough

200
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,010
developer jobs for everybody, you don't need to beat out everybody to be the number one developer.

201
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,380
So that mentality was I was a little bit annoying to me.

202
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,140
But then again, I worked in Toronto and Silicon Valley, and I think those areas especially have have

203
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,790
really, really strong, individualistic philosophies.

204
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,040
All right.

205
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,900
This is another question from from where and how did you learn and become a developer?

206
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,090
So when I started to learn to be a developer, I probably spent, I would say twenty dollars.

207
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:30,450
I think I bought a book on HTML and access and the rest was all online for free, just using online

208
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,130
resources.

209
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,840
The only difference was that when I started to learn there were very few resources online.

210
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:44,880
I think I used one blog post that that told me to use Photoshop and -- and and some tools that actually

211
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,960
didn't even need.

212
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,040
But it was really hard to find resources online when I started to learn.

213
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:58,500
So I essentially just try to grab as many resources as possible and create my own curriculum.

214
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,320
But it's not like it is now, I think right now we have a lot of resources online, it's a lot easier

215
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,400
and there's more of a clear cut path to become a web developer.

216
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,110
So I'm a little bit jealous.

217
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,390
But I also did the same thing that you probably are doing, which is watch a lot of online courses,

218
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:22,440
read a lot of books, read a lot of articles, and most importantly, building my own projects and coding

219
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,310
as much as possible.

220
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,680
But nothing beats actually coding.

221
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,480
You can watch videos all day, but if you're not doing anything, if you're not producing anything,

222
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,590
that's not.

223
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,280
It's like watching a tennis match and trying to become a better tennis player.

224
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,420
It's just not going to happen.

225
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,140
We have a Jamie who asks, what's the best way you could practice code?

226
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,460
Is it good for him?

227
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,380
Is it good by imitating someone else code for practicing again?

228
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,760
Goes back to my last point.

229
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,310
The best way to practice code is to code.

230
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,640
The the more you code, the more you practice, the better it is.

231
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,000
But keep in mind that the best way to code is to solve your own problems, create your own projects.

232
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:05,880
I actually don't recommend just watching all my videos and following along without coding because then

233
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,230
you're not going to be able to do things on your own.

234
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,720
The best way to code is to code by by doing your own thing.

235
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,590
You can watch a hundred videos on people coding and follow along.

236
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,500
But if you don't understand why we're doing things, then when you're left to your own device, you're

237
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,350
not going to be able to do anything.

238
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,580
So the best way to code is think of a project today.

239
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:37,770
Think of a task that you have to do over and over in your life and see if you can automated with code.

240
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,860
That's the best way to to learn.

241
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,510
Kailin, what you ask?

242
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,800
What is your favorite text stack?

243
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,520
My favorite test tech stack is the one that lets me accomplish my goal as fast as possible.

244
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,390
That's a very vague answer.

245
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:59,020
But honestly, anything that lets me finish fast and deliver something fast is my favorite textbook

246
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,290
because I tend to work by myself or in small teams.

247
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,940
I really prefer things that are efficient.

248
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:13,260
So, for example, I'm not a big fan of TypeScript because although you get type safety and static typing,

249
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,990
it's a lot of extra code.

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,040
It's the same reason that I personally am not a big fan of Java programming, not because it's not a

251
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:27,330
great language, but because for my personal use cases, I'm not working at a big company with thousands

252
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,060
of developers for, let's say, a financial institution.

253
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,660
If I'm building a personal project, I'd rather use something quick and easy, like Python or JavaScript,

254
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,100
to write a few lines of code and accomplish a goal.

255
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,260
So there's really no favorite text that the stack that allows me to accomplish the goal the fastest,

256
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,950
which happens to be usually dynamically typed languages and usually the languages that I'm comfortable

257
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,540
with, I don't need to learn something new until I have a need to to learn something.

258
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,170
All right.

259
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,580
Moralez Junior s Moralez Junior.

260
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,150
That's what it is.

261
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,140
Any advice on escaping the golden handcuffs and going freelance?

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,660
I have a cushy non developer job at Google and it's hard to imagine leaving when a family and a mortgage.

263
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,000
But I long for freedom.

264
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:21,300
And this this topic of freelancer is another topic that has come up many, many times.

265
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,740
So let me address it right now.

266
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,260
I, I get to work remotely.

267
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,790
I get to work for myself, which I feel very fortunate, fortunate about, and I'm extremely lucky.

268
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,980
But when it comes to freelancing, I actually am against freelancing.

269
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,900
Obviously every situation is different.

270
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,750
But let me explain why I think freelancing might not be the best option for most of you.

271
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,130
Not all of you, but for most of you.

272
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,260
You see, when it comes to freelancing, let's say you are just starting to learn.

273
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,910
You're just learning to cope.

274
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,430
If you go straight into freelancing, you lose the ability to work with others, to learn from others

275
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,800
and actually be in a company and understand how their processes work, how they work with developers.

276
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,440
You gain a lot of experience by working on projects with others, with other developers, working with

277
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,720
management teams, working with with project managers, scrum masters.

278
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,240
That's a really, really valuable experience that I really recommend for people just getting into coding.

279
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,480
Now, let's say that you've had a couple of years of experience.

280
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,760
You've worked with teams, you have that experience.

281
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,470
Should you go into freelancing?

282
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,600
I think you should go into freelancing.

283
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,460
If you have a clear edge or a clear advantage over others.

284
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,000
For example, you have an existing client base and you have people that really trust your work or you

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,140
offer a really unique skill.

286
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:54,870
The problem with freelancing right now is that you're essentially battling with thousands, potentially

287
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,320
millions of other freelancers to get a job.

288
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,460
A lot of people might go to places like uptalk or any type of place where you can bid on projects.

289
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:13,850
What happens is in those scenarios, people just bid and it's a battle to lower and lower prices.

290
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,720
So what happens?

291
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,720
You eventually become an employee of a contract that you probably didn't charge enough for.

292
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,580
So it's really hard for you to compete with people that keep lowering and lowering and lowering prices.

293
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,290
And you'll see that if you're a freelancer, that's what will happen unless you have an established

294
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:40,430
client base, unless you have a really distinct advantage, maybe you're extremely skilled in graphic

295
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,270
design and you're well known, then, yes, maybe you can charge more for it.

296
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:50,240
But people that are usually looking for freelancers are usually looking for the cheapest price.

297
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,720
And when you do that, you stop valuing your time.

298
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,820
You stop being a slave to the person that created the contract and you're trying to fulfill somebody

299
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:08,150
you're trying to fulfill and please this person so that they give you a good review for the next contract

300
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,450
job.

301
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:17,090
I think freelancer jobs are can be good, but there's also a lot of issues that come with it if you

302
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,970
want to be a freelancer or perhaps be your own boss.

303
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,150
I think there's better ways for you to to go about it.

304
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,410
I think there's smarter ways to go about it instead of competing with others on price.

305
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,150
So I know that's not really helpful, is just my personal opinion when it comes to freelancing.

306
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,550
But it is a question that I get asked a lot.

307
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,270
Freelancing essentially involves you taking a lot of time finding clients, working a lot for clients.

308
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,460
And at the end of the day, why not just work for a company that already has the clients for you so

309
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,870
you can gain that experience?

310
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:59,270
You might think you have the freedom of being a freelancer, being your own job, but instead your you

311
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,030
are an employee of whoever your contractor is.

312
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,870
That's my advice.

313
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,630
I know it's not it's not very, very helpful.

314
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,530
But like I said, it's not for everybody.

315
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,970
I think there's there's better opportunities for you to work remotely.

316
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,830
You can work for remote companies.

317
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,890
There's tons of websites right now of showing companies that hire remote workers.

318
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,540
I think that's a better option for you than being a freelancer, because the reasons that I mentioned

319
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:34,640
previously, Jati Evars eight ask how is life as far as time spent with family and doing what you like

320
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,580
now as an instructor and before when you work for a company, do you enjoy work more now or before?

321
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,360
When you work for a company hands down?

322
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,920
I absolutely love what I'm doing now.

323
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,380
I wake up every day and all I can think about is, is work and what I'm going to teach or what video

324
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,680
I'm going to record or what coding challenge I'm going to do.

325
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:01,880
I am I feel so extremely lucky to be at a point in my life where I absolutely adore and love what I'm

326
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,240
doing.

327
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,350
And I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,130
Being a developer was absolutely great, working full time for a company.

329
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,380
I loved it and I had a lot of friends.

330
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,350
I got along really well with with my bosses, with my clients.

331
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:25,340
But having having the freedom to to work on what I want to work on my projects.

332
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:32,150
But most importantly, knowing that the work that I do maybe impacts just a little bit a little bit

333
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,290
of of the world, I think is a really rewarding feeling.

334
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,870
And I'm extremely thankful to to know that, you know, not everybody's going to love my courses, but

335
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:48,230
at least there are some that do enjoy my courses and gain a bit of help in their career through it.

336
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,360
And that is the most rewarding feeling.

337
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,360
And honestly, the past two years since I've started to teach have been some of the happiest moments

338
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,470
of my life.

339
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,430
And I know this thing isn't going to last forever.

340
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,130
I know I'm not going to teach forever, but I'm really appreciative of this moment to have this opportunity,

341
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
at least for now.

342
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,330
All right.

343
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:15,710
Mr. Luciferase asks a safe, secure and stable life, being a skillful employee, working for someone

344
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,670
else or dreaming big and starting a business on your own and being your own boss, what path do you

345
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,280
suggest?

346
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,470
Honestly, it really depends.

347
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,950
I think everybody wants the ideal work for yourself, own your own business, work remotely, live wherever

348
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,400
you want.

349
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,210
It sounds sexy, but it's it's not for everybody.

350
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,540
And, you know, I before I started teaching, before I was a developer, I started a bunch of businesses.

351
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,200
I was running, surfing, yoga, retreat in Nicaragua.

352
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,660
I was doing adventure tours.

353
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,940
I was doing adventurous businesses.

354
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,340
I was trying all these different things that in the end weren't extremely successful.

355
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,470
But there are a lot of fun and.

356
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,350
Meanwhile, I had friends who were doing their MBAs, there were becoming lawyers, and, you know,

357
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,980
they have really nice life right now.

358
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,260
They have to have families.

359
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,290
They're very comfortable.

360
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:16,590
And there's actually there's actually an advantage there as you start to work at a company and you see

361
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,760
people leave that company, most people think, oh, I should I should leave, too.

362
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,830
But you can also look at it as an opportunity for somebody else has left.

363
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:32,780
Now, you are one step closer to going up that that corporate or company ladder.

364
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,160
So I think it's not it's not one is better than the other.

365
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,950
It really depends on why you prefer what kind of lifestyle you prefer.

366
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,410
Do you want more of a stable, comfortable life to make sure that you can provide for your family?

367
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,690
Or are you at a stage in your life where you can perhaps take more risks and you're OK with the highs

368
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,210
ups in high high downs, high ups and downs that may pay off?

369
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,450
Not in the end, but I think every day if you're working towards what your ideal life should look like,

370
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
eventually you will get there.

371
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,050
But don't expect to get there overnight.

372
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,720
It's it's hard work.

373
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,600
Nothing comes easy.

374
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,240
There's no easy solution.

375
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:17,520
So all you can do is kind of work towards that goal and learn every day and improve every day and eventually

376
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,270
you'll get there.

377
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,880
But it really matters.

378
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,100
It's the best thing you can do is to have a plan for yourself and write down what you value.

379
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,920
And based on those values and what makes you happy, decide what type of path you want to take.

380
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,570
I got all philosophical there for you.

381
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,190
All right.

382
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,530
Let's get back to some coding.

383
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,390
Justin Hey.

384
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,190
Justin asks, How do you decide to learn next in this ever changing landscape?

385
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,910
From Braddock's graphic, you all react to angular view SSR.

386
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,770
There's so much to learn, so little time.

387
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,010
So I guess how do you decide what to learn then and how you actually learn to make time for it?

388
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,330
I think this is actually something I, I'm pretty good at or I think I'm good at.

389
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,750
And that is because when I started to learn how to code, I realized how much is out there.

390
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,770
I've become I've become really good at selecting only the right things to learn.

391
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,450
There's the famous Parado Principle which says the 20 percent usually accounts for 80 percent of value.

392
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:25,350
So what's the 20 percent that's going to give you 80 percent of a value in learning and things like

393
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,790
you all, for example?

394
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,130
They're extremely popular.

395
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,000
So a lot of people want to learn it.

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,950
But at the end of the day, how many how many people actually use graphical in production?

397
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,320
How many people have actually built something with graphics?

398
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,350
All that creates a value.

399
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,070
I like to look at technologies and see see what's what's hot and what's trending, but not necessarily

400
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,530
jump really deep into them until there's a clear need for me to learn it.

401
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,920
So, for example.

402
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,980
Yes, yeah, I know a bit of yes, but I want to call myself an expert because I haven't had to use

403
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,090
the you know, I can use react or I can use angular.

404
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,480
So being selective in why you learn instead of trying to learn everything is going to be better long

405
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,430
term strategy over the course of your career, because learning never stops and the more you learn,

406
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,450
the more you start to realize that it's not about the syntax, it's not about learning the libraries.

407
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,750
It's not about reading the documentation from start to finish.

408
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,510
It's about understanding the higher principles.

409
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,940
The why was this tool built?

410
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,040
Why are we doing things the way it is?

411
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,480
What problem is it solving?

412
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,290
Being able to understand those and discuss those is going to be really, really important because at

413
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,670
the end of the day, the fundamentals is is what matters, not the syntax.

414
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,670
If you learn the fundamentals, if you learn to think like a developer, think about systems and how

415
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,600
things communicate.

416
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,490
That's a lot more valuable than learning the newest react Hoke's API.

417
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,350
I mean, that could still be important.

418
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,290
But but as you can see, I'm very selective in what I learn.

419
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,600
And I'm not I'm not trying to learn ten languages at the same time.

420
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,770
If I want to learn something, I'll dedicate maybe a year to get a really, really good at something

421
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,300
and then move on to the next thing.

422
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:25,800
So really being picky, as if you're dating a new technology and making sure that it's the right one

423
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,820
is the way to go.

424
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,860
Oh, and with that said, you obviously have to enjoy what you're doing.

425
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,100
If you don't enjoy learning, then that's going to be really hard.

426
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:41,670
So that's just something that has to come for yourself and being able to enjoy the learning process,

427
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,860
because that's that's going to be your biggest asset.

428
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,620
If you enjoy learning, you're going to learn more.

429
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,400
Adrien asks, How long do you plan on continuing doing courses?

430
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,540
Because, well, this isn't going to last forever, right?

431
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,720
Honestly, I'm not sure I'm it's been close to two years now that I've been doing this.

432
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,900
I don't imagine doing this for for a lifetime.

433
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,860
There's only so much I could teach.

434
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,460
I'm going to keep going until I.

435
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,270
I stop enjoying it right now.

436
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,500
I really enjoyed the process.

437
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,370
I get a lot of reward by by hearing your your reviews and how pleased you are with the courses.

438
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,410
So that really drives me to create more.

439
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,840
But eventually I will have to stop.

440
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,820
I can't just keep creating courses.

441
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,030
They they do take a lot of time and effort.

442
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,330
So I hope that I can keep going for for a few more years.

443
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:39,280
But one day maybe you retire and and spend a little more time with family or move on to something else.

444
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,010
But for now, don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

445
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,340
Balloon asks, Do you play any instruments?

446
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,370
No, I am the least musically talented, artistically talented person you'll ever be.

447
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,580
I took piano lessons, guitar lessons when I was a kid.

448
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,770
And I'm I'm hopeless.

449
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:03,100
Thank God coding exists and thank God sports exists, because if if I had to do anything in the arts,

450
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,820
I would be I would not be very good.

451
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,010
Garrison asks if it would be really inspirational for all of us.

452
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:15,100
Who or what do you want to do with the next ten years of your life coaching business?

453
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,230
Looks like he is the same age as me.

454
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,190
So just asking what's what's the next ten years of my life look like?

455
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,740
The next ten years of my life is going to involve learning every day I want to, whether it's coding,

456
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,060
whether it's different things.

457
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,780
I have different hobbies that I want to keep improving at.

458
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,680
I really like surfing, so I want to become a better surfer.

459
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,440
And there's so many things that I really want to improve.

460
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,080
So honestly, every single day my goal is to learn.

461
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,260
I want to hopefully have a family by then and have a house and and just enjoy life.

462
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:55,900
And hopefully in 10 years I'm retired, being able to being able to spend every single day with my son

463
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,690
or daughter and just enjoying life.

464
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:04,150
But honestly, what I'm doing now is not much different than what I hope to be doing ten years from

465
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,890
now, because I am really, really happy with with how life is right now.

466
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,200
And I wouldn't really change anything.

467
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,870
Dorion, again, do you think all the races you do and yoga and exercises help you mental clarity and

468
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,410
have helped your career as a developer when things get rough?

469
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,780
Yeah, so fun fact.

470
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,630
I'm I'm also a yoga instructor on the side and I do, I do a lot of adventure racing as well.

471
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:35,440
And both of those things I think actually really help with being a developer and dealing with different

472
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,580
situations at work.

473
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,790
I think for adventure racing it it puts you into situations that are extremely uncomfortable that you

474
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,740
have to just survive through.

475
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,320
And then with yoga, obviously, it's still in your mind, especially with meditation as well.

476
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,750
I think those are extremely important, especially when compared to coding, when you're staring at

477
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,900
the screen and everything is usually fast paced and it's really, really easy to get lost in your head.

478
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,120
I think balancing out coding with something that's complete opposite, like yoga and meditation, again,

479
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:18,580
not to get a little hippy here, but I think doing different things is is important and being physically

480
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,250
active, being mentally strong.

481
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,860
Is this is your vessel and this is your body and you should take care of it and it'll only improve you

482
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,630
as a developer and as a coder.

483
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,420
So I one hundred percent think that although for some people it may be silly to meditate, although

484
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,280
for some people they don't actually enjoy exercising, everybody has their different things.

485
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,410
But I think doing something other than coding is really, really important for that balance.

486
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:51,250
And to not burn yourself, burn yourself out assim PubMed, ask about interview and the fact that he's

487
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,090
really worried about interviews and that he doesn't know enough.

488
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,550
And honestly, just keep this in mind because because this is something I hear from so many people.

489
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,730
Everybody is just a child trapped in an adult's body.

490
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,850
No human knows everything perfectly.

491
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,430
And most likely the person sitting across from you that's asking you a question on a on an interview

492
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:22,930
doesn't know everything, has their own insecurities, has their own areas that they're not an expert

493
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,050
in.

494
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,000
So go into an interview knowing that this person is not God.

495
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,600
It's not the ultimate smartest person that you'll ever meet.

496
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,550
They have their flaws and their issues.

497
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:40,120
And if you start to realize that there's no such thing as a perfect developer of perfect kotin, everybody

498
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,450
is just trying to pretend like they're smart.

499
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,580
Everybody's just trying to pretend like they're an adult.

500
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,300
Remember everybody, just a kid inside, trapped inside an adult's body.

501
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,030
You start to realize that this.

502
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:58,650
All world that we live in, this whole system that we're in is just a game just like your Khoder, just

503
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,680
like you're a programmer and you're trying to create a system.

504
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:10,390
This is simply a system that you need to learn to adapt to and to try to essentially beat or improve.

505
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,220
So put yourself in their situation.

506
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,000
They want to feel important.

507
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,780
They want to feel like they're doing a good job.

508
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:23,730
So maybe asking them questions during the interview, maybe praising them for something that they did,

509
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,380
even though they're the ones being interviewed, is going to make them feel better.

510
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,280
That perhaps will make them ask you better or easier questions again.

511
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,990
Think of it as a system.

512
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,610
Think of it as a game and realize that there is nothing.

513
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,370
Nothing is extremely serious and important.

514
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,490
Everything is just a game they can play and that you can improve.

515
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:51,300
And if you start looking at life, good interviews as a as a game, I think it becomes a lot more fun.

516
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,550
And it also remove some of those insecurities.

517
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,420
I don't know if that answer help, but kind of went on a tangent there.

518
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,190
But hopefully that that helps a little bit.

519
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,030
All right.

520
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,110
Last question, because this video is getting a little too long.

521
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,610
So Charles mentioned it asks, what's the difficult day for you at the moment?

522
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:16,380
Your courses are very that's very kind of you seem to be your healthy way of living in your sporty attitude.

523
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,650
It all must be worth a course on how to balance your life and the way you do things while you quote.

524
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:30,090
I guess I kind of already talked about this, but my my everyday life usually involves in the morning

525
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:37,140
drinking coffee, reading articles and catching up in the industry, learning a little bit.

526
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,790
I really like Morning for Learning and then I usually either record or plan recording or edit videos

527
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,930
in the afternoon.

528
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:52,020
Then around one two o'clock I usually go out for a run, do some exercises, try to get outside, not

529
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,630
stare at the screen and and be active.

530
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:01,920
And then I come back, I usually check out my emails, answer questions, go on Dischord and chat with

531
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,760
other students.

532
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,700
And then usually by five o'clock I'm done.

533
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,170
I don't do any work.

534
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,670
I stop whatever I'm doing because I know after five o'clock, for me personally, I'm not productive.

535
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:19,950
So I usually spend time with family, with my girlfriend or do social activities or maybe go play some

536
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,780
tennis, go play some soccer, go for a hike just to relax.

537
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,520
And I usually go to bed at ten o'clock.

538
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,660
Not that very exciting.

539
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,720
I don't I don't enjoy going to bars or clubs anymore.

540
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,150
I'm, I'm an old soul and at o'clock I'm ready for bed and I'm ready for the next day.

541
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,730
So a pretty, pretty boring day.

542
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,990
Nothing too exciting.

543
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,830
But it's it's it's what I like right now.

544
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,710
Anyway, this this was the and video again, I want to thank you.

545
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,840
I cannot believe that there's one hundred thousand students that are taking my courses.

546
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,930
And honestly, if it was just me, I would never get to one hundred thousand students.

547
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:07,860
Every single one of you that talk to others recommend my courses that really help me get to where I

548
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,130
am.

549
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:16,050
And I cannot express how thankful I am for for everything that that you have done that you have shown

550
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,740
support for.

551
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,490
And I am I hope to continue to keep impressing you and keep helping you with your learning journey.

552
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,450
And, yeah, I'm I'm really, really thankful.

553
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,550
So thank you.
