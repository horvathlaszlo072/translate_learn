00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,990
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,080
In this video, I want to show you all those things that we were talking about when it came to the actual

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,640
dam making updates.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,880
I mentioned how the virtual dam is going to do some comparisons between a snapshot virtual dam and an

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,370
updating virtual dam.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,710
And what it does is it modifies the actual dam once it determines the correct things to re render.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,910
So we can actually visualize this with a tool instead of chrome dev tools.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,920
And I want to take a quick moment to show it to you.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,740
Here, in order for us to see this, what I'm going to do is make one quick modification where I'm going

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,710
to bring in a title and a subtitle.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,010
And we're really just setting it up like this so that we can have more examples where we can visualize

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,150
what's actually happening.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,080
So here I'm going to duplicate our search box.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm going to add a line break into our component.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,650
Just so that we can see these two search boxes separated from each other.

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,530
And instead of an on search change, I'm just going to copy this and call this on title change.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,700
Because that's exactly what we're modifying.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,590
So we're really just duplicating the behavior of our search change handler with a title change handler,

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,120
and the whole idea here is just that we want to set the title.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,180
And the reason why we want to set this title.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,250
So I'm going to put that there.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,860
Let's call this our title search box.

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,950
So again, the reason why we're trying to set our title is because we want to visualize some of these

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,970
changes because we only want to modify certain parts of the page.

25
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,220
And here you're going to see that.

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,930
So let's just save this again, we've modified our title, so now we have this title.

27
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,550
If we go back to the code.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,420
We see that we have this title and we see that we have no title.

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,950
So as we start typing.

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,080
You'll see this title up here.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,120
And again, our previous search bar functionality still works.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,450
What I do want you to notice about this is that inside of here, if we go to more tools.

33
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,030
You want to click rendering.

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,290
And what this will do is open up this screen where we can enable paint flashing.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,610
Paint is a terminology that is used by the DOM to determine what is actually being rendered or re rendered

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,840
onto the DOM itself.

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,870
Some of the Dom mounts nodes modifies nodes or takes node off that is all repainting.

38
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,960
So that process that we mentioned that is expensive for the DOM.

39
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,090
That is the painting process.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,350
So here what happens when we check this is that whenever components are being modified, you'll notice

41
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,370
that they flash green.

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,500
So one of the dom has to make any changes repainting on to the dom itself.

43
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,990
Then that node or that component or that element is going to flash green.

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,700
So notice how when I refresh the page, we see all of the flash green.

45
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,880
The reason for that is because everything is being mounted onto the page or painted onto the page for

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,690
the very first time.

47
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,330
So, of course, all of those different things are going to flash green.

48
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,360
Now, if I start typing into this title, I want you to notice something that the first time I type

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,080
this entire page flashes green, but every subsequent character only modifies.

50
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,670
The actual.

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,420
Title itself, why is this?

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,180
The reason for this is because of reflow.

53
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Remember when I mentioned that the Dom needs the reflow whenever a component gets added onto the site.

54
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not just exclusive to adding as long as the layout needs to be shifted in this particular case,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,030
when this one is empty, it has no height.

56
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,760
Even though the H1 you'll notice, is still actually on the website.

57
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,360
The thing, though, is that it takes up no height right now, but the moment it starts taking up height,

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:15,640
what happens is that it needs to shift the entire page down because there is now a new element that

59
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,770
is taking up space on the top.

60
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,270
So that is reflow.

61
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,390
Generally speaking, this reflow process is not that expensive, so it's OK.

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,880
If you see a lot of this green flashing from this.

63
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,460
Really, what you just want to notice is there are certain things that you want to work within an expected

64
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,030
behavior.

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,240
So if components are being added or removed from the page, you should expect reflow of the entire page.

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,910
Another example is, let's say I start modifying search monsters here as we type.

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,850
You'll notice that as the cards get removed from the page, we're also free-flowing the entire document.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,010
So this is also OK.

69
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,980
You'll see this pattern pretty much everywhere and react applications.

70
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,840
I just don't want you to be too surprised when you start seeing these big flashes everywhere.

71
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,900
But the key thing to really notice, though, is just the fact that when components are being mounted

72
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,340
and I'm mounted, there is this free flow going on, which is essentially a paint process.

73
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,250
However, if everything is on the page and things are just being modified, well, again, you'll notice

74
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,950
that React will make sure to only modify the portions that are relevant.

75
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,900
And that's what really great about this paint flashing tool because we can really visualize the way

76
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,960
that react determines how a component re renders and which components we render, and then in turn,

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,410
which reflective nodes on the Dom tree to repaint.

78
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,140
It's really just that step by step by step by step process that react goes through helping us build

79
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,060
our UI.

80
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,370
So hopefully, whenever you want to see what your components are rendering and what is being repainted,

81
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,370
you can just remember you want to go into your developer tools.

82
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,490
You want to click these three dots, go to more tools, click on the rendering and then enable paint

83
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,860
flashing and you'll see what gets re render.

84
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,590
So now that we have gone through and understood how the virtual DOM works, let's move on.
