00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,240
Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,770
In this video, I want to quickly show you how you can get your environment set up so that you can coat

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,120
along inside of this course if you are on a Windows computer.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:20,690
Now, in the Windows computer, there's a couple of different terminal options you have the main one

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,050
that I think is very useful is the one that comes integrated with Visual Studio Code.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:33,650
The benefit of this as well is that because I use visual studio code as my editor, if you're unfamiliar

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,520
with EDS, you can easily use visual studio code and you'll be able to follow everything that I'm doing

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,870
with my editor because we both would end up using the exact same editor.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,670
So in order to use visual studio code, I'm going to paste for you a link inside of your resources that

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,430
you can use to get the talent.

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,390
So simply hit download for Windows and wait for the download to complete.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,040
Once your visual pseudocode finishes downloading, simply go to the folder that you set it in.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,320
So in my case, it's in my downloads folder.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,390
And just simply double click to install it.

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,650
Now, inside of here, you're going to be asked for a license agreement, so simply accept the agreement

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,930
and then you'll have these boxes that you can check.

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,800
Now, I would probably check all the ones that are unchecked, but what this allows you to do is access

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,190
visual studio code through different settings on your computer so you can use it to open up your projects.

19
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,650
Simply hit next and then install.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,120
Once it's finished, we can simply launch Visual Studio code and then inside a visual studio code.

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,810
You now have your editor.

22
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,000
So in order for you to actually open up the terminal that I have here, simply go up to the terminal

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,920
tab and hit new terminal.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,690
And this will now open up the terminal that you have by default set up inside of your Windows computer.

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,940
If you have installed other shells, you'll be able to select them from the dropdown.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,600
But in my case, I only have power, which is the default shell that comes with the computer.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:28,790
So what I'm going to do now is I am going to actually install a different one called Get Back Now with

28
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,510
Get Getback.

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,810
You are now able to access the underlying get projects and give folders that we will use throughout

30
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,690
this course because we want to push to GitHub.

31
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,470
So use the link that I provided for you and simply download.

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,390
Now, this will download this the same way that we just downloaded Visual Studio code and just save

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,820
it wherever you want to, once it's finished downloading, go to the folder where it's downloaded to

34
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,270
and simply run it as well.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Now, this will ask you if you allow it to make changes now you want to hit.

36
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:12,500
Yes, because this will install bash instead of power shell, which comes with much easier to understand

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,130
controls.

38
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,830
Now, here it I'll ask you if you wanted to allow you to install different things, and in my case,

39
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,670
I just want to add another icon on the desktop so it's easy to launch.

40
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,940
And then by default, it'll ask you whatever you want to use, so usually them is the one that most

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,870
people are comfortable with or visual studio code, which we just downloaded.

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,330
If you want it to be the one that opens whenever you want to modify files and text files.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,390
But we'll explore that a little later.

44
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,600
For now, I'm just going to stick to them and hit next.

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,900
And then I want to run it from my command line.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:02,810
And then I want to also use open SSL in order to validate my get, you can just hit next for this.

47
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,630
And for here, you can also use get bashes, own minty terminal emulator.

48
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,720
So this one is entirely up to you.

49
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,330
I personally, I'm going to use the get provided minty and then I'm just going to hit next.

50
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,790
Again, experimental is up to you.

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,750
Whether or not you want to opt in or not to these new commands, it does not really matter.

52
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm not going to opt in.

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,680
And I'm just going to wait for the install to finish now, once everything's installed, simply hit

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,260
finish and then go back to your visual studio code and close it.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,880
So we need to actually access the new terminal because we have a new shell.

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,110
So to do this, just reopen Visual Studio code after you've closed it.

57
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,170
And then inside of this dropdown, what we're going to do is we are going to hit select default shell.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,000
And we are going to choose our get back.

59
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,950
Now, this will switch our main terminal whenever we add a new one or whenever we open our terminal

60
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,730
to use our new get Batia and the way to do that is now you simply hit this plus icon, which you'll

61
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,340
see is now Basche, and then you just close your old power shell by switching back to it and hitting

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,060
the garbage can.

63
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,250
And now you have Basche set up as your main terminal.

64
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,600
Now, if you see these colors, when you switch to bash, that means that you are running the Mincy

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,200
emulator, if you remember in those settings when we were installing GET.

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,090
So this is actually a quality of life emulator.

67
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,470
It just makes different things in the terminal prettier as well as easier to understand and reason about.

68
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,720
You can, of course, run other emulators if you want, such as DSL, which is what I have when you

69
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,570
watch my course, but in our case, Menti is fine for windows.

70
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,280
Now, what we need to install next is node.

71
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,350
Node is actually what's going to allow us to run JavaScript inside of our terminal.

72
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,030
What we have to do is we have to go to this website of no jobs and simply download the installer equivalent

73
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,700
to whatever bit your windows is.

74
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,200
So minus 64, I'm just going to download the 64 bit one.

75
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,110
Once it's finished downloading, open the folder and then just run the node installer.

76
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,330
Now, node is what we need in order for us to run our JavaScript as well as manage our JavaScript packages

77
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,080
for all of the applications that will be building.

78
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,240
So simply hit next, accept the licensing agreement install node.

79
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,720
And then hit next again and finally install.

80
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,630
Now note also comes with NPM, which is no package manager, and we want to yes here as well when it

81
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,720
asks if it allows us to make changes to our device.

82
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,840
And no package manager is what allows us to manage different versions of note now the versions of note

83
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,490
all come with different features and note is always being updated.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,750
But we want to just use the latest version of Noad at the time of when you watch this video.

85
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,770
And usually that's what this link will recommend you as well.

86
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,100
It'll try and give you the latest version.

87
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,470
So simply wait until our note is finished installing and once it's finished, simply had finish.

88
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,300
Now we have to make sure that node and AMPM are properly installed on our computer.

89
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:41,580
So the way we do that is we just have to close our visual studio code and reopen it again because we

90
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,120
need to see and load a new version of our terminal.

91
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,620
And once our terminal comes in, we simply type in no dash.

92
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,360
And we should see some number, so this will tell us the version of note that we currently have installed.

93
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,410
If we had NPM Dashkova, we'll see the version of NPM we have installed.

94
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,860
Now that you have NPM a node, you can actually run through this course, the only thing is that I use

95
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,550
yarn as my packaging manager instead of NPM.

96
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,060
Now, yarn and NPM are pretty much the same thing.

97
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,990
The only thing was that there was a period of time where NPM was kind of buggy.

98
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,410
And what Facebook did was they created yarn so that it was a more efficient package manager.

99
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,180
But NPM has since then caught up.

100
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,060
Now you can easily Google all of the commands that you need that are the same replacements for what's

101
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,850
used in yarn if you want to just use NPM.

102
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,180
But if you want to use yarn, I'm going to show you how to download yarn.

103
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,890
So simply copy the resource that I've given you inside of your resource folder that says yarn and then

104
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,360
paste it into your browser.

105
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,820
And once you're on this page, make sure your operating system is Windows and your version is stable.

106
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,400
Then you just click download installer.

107
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,700
Now you'll see here that it says that we can only do this after we've installed no gess, which we just

108
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:03,970
did.

109
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,750
So with this, once it's finished, we simply go to where we've installed it and run the installer.

110
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,000
We're going to accept the license hit next and then finally hit and stop.

111
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,490
We want to allow it to make changes and we finish and now we need to go back to our visual studio code,

112
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,300
close it again and rerun it, because we need to make sure that we have the version of yarn installed

113
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,200
on our computer.

114
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,600
So what we can do inside of our terminal is just type yard Dash V once it's finished loading.

115
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,360
And we should see the version that we just installed and with this, your environment is now set up

116
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
for the rest of the course.

117
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,750
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
