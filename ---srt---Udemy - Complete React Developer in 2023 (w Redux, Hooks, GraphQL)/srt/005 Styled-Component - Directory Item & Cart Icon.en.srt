1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,320
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,860
In this video, we are going to style out the cart icon with style components, so as normal we are

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,920
going to first convert our style sheet over to a chair sex.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,670
And the key difference in this component is primarily that there is an SPG in here.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:25,740
Now, one thing I want to note about converting and targeting SDGs is that you can even do this without

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,620
star components.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
So I'm going to show you how I would tackle styling this specific component.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,990
Normally you got to think about your components when it comes to whether or not you want to make a brand

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,910
new component to wrap it, or if you want to target some other way.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,970
So the way that we want to target the shopping icon is we know that there's some styling that's going

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,310
to be applied on this component.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:58,000
And as I mentioned before, we can actually directly just target our own components, including these

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,560
SPG components.

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:07,180
So here what we can do is we can actually say export contest shopping icon.

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,970
And instead of this being shopping icon, let's call this shopping SPG because we want shopping icon

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,490
to be the name of the store component that we expose.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,830
I'm going to say styled on this shopping SPG component and then what I'm going to apply is the styling

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,130
here with the width 24 and the height 24.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,610
And then we can just stop everything else as normal.

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,130
So here I'm going to do.

21
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,330
Carl Icahn container.

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,990
Which is astounding.

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,030
Let's just fix that.

24
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,580
That will have this width.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,910
Now, as I mentioned before, instead of doing it this way, you could have also technically targeted

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,310
it with the SVG.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,150
Like so?

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:09,530
Which is the typical styling way, but this way I find it a little bit more within the alignment of

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,870
house style component wants you to write your components.

30
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,610
And then the last thing is our item count, which I believe is a span.

31
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,360
Yes, it is.

32
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,050
So here we can just paste in those styles that we had.

33
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,650
And we can save this and now import this into our component.

34
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,990
So of course, now we already have this coming from our stylesheet now.

35
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,910
So we got our shopping icon, a cart icon container, as well as our item count.

36
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,940
So now our shopping icon can stay the same.

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,880
This will replace the div right here.

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,410
And then the item count, of course, will replace the spam.

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,140
And there we go.

40
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,930
If we go back to our application, we see that everything here still works.

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,800
Our icon still has the styling, it's still at the appropriate size.

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,850
So now let's stall the next thing, and this is our directory item.

43
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,190
So the directory item styles are pretty comprehensive.

44
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,170
Plus, there's one additional thing that we're going to learn through styling the directory item because

45
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:39,340
right now we actually apply a custom style property using what React gives us as this style prop.

46
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,390
We actually don't need this because we can pass props directly into all of our components that we make

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,410
with style components.

48
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,400
And this is actually a very, very powerful thing because now what we can do is we can treat these components

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,420
as if they were regular components, but there's a little bit of syntax we have to learn.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,590
So let me show you so first, we import stuff from style components.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,640
And now what we need to do is let's think about what it is exactly that we're trying to do here.

52
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,160
So first things first, let's talk about the targeting.

53
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,510
This component needs to target a background image class.

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,270
We can actually make a component for this background image, but we have to make it in the order in

55
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,920
which it will get called.

56
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,310
So if inside of directory item container, one of our styles targets this component, then we need to

57
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,350
have that component already declared.

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,330
So here I'm going to say Konst background image is equal to a style div, because that's what this background

59
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,840
image is.

60
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,470
So this style div is going to have a couple styling on it by default.

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,400
So the first one is going to be all of these styles.

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,020
So let's just copy this over.

63
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:07,540
And then when it's going to have is typically when you use this background image, as you can see here

64
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,420
in this, did we pass the stop, but we can't do this anymore.

65
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,540
Instead, what we're going to do is we are going to actually pass this as a value and we can call it

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,290
image URL.

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,580
You can call it whatever you want.

68
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,240
It's really just the prop name that we're going to access the same way we will later inside of our components.

69
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,530
So let's imagine instead, I pass image URL into this component.

70
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:37,390
The way that I can access is I can actually say background image is going to point to and then I'm going

71
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,700
to string interpolate because this is just a tactic string.

72
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:51,040
So now I can actually access the different props that get received in just the way that you would like

73
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,640
a component.

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,880
You write a function.

75
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,480
And what this will be is props, which means that we can d structure off image URL because that is being

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
passed in as a prop.

77
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:08,140
And now what we can do is we can return back a string that says your URL wrapping the image URL.

78
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,080
It's the same thing that we had before, but now we're passing in as a prop and then rendering it within

79
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,060
the CSC of our background image.

80
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,650
So after this, now we need also to look inside.

81
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,170
Notice how we're also targeting a body.

82
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,300
We're changing the opacity when this component gets hovered on.

83
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,550
So we actually need this body first before we can target it inside the component.

84
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:39,640
So I want to say body is equal to a stop div and this style div is going to accept all of this styling

85
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,060
here.

86
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,620
And also inside it targets the H2 and the pea tag.

87
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,510
So if you're wondering with this H2 and this is it worth creating a new, separate style component for

88
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,630
it?

89
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,730
Well, this is where you need to think.

90
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,180
If you know that your component only has one H2 and one paragraph tank inside of this body div, then

91
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,990
you don't need to.

92
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,670
If you start adding more tools and you want different styling, then you can start splitting it up more

93
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,790
at a granular level into more different style components.

94
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,560
But generally speaking, it's based on how you would normally write your CC anyways.

95
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,030
So this is one of those things.

96
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,220
It's just really a matter of thinking about your composition and what you need and what you don't need.

97
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,240
So now that we have both the background image and the body, we can finally do export content directory

98
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,320
item container.

99
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,720
And here it'll be equal to a stop to.

100
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,890
And inside, let's add these styles, so this hover style is very important.

101
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,750
We want to take this over.

102
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,430
And inside notice on the hover.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,290
So here we target a background image instead of what we're going to target is directly the background

104
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,920
image.

105
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,600
So component that we have and the same thing is going to apply for the body.

106
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,150
And that.

107
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,850
Is pretty much all we need unless I'm missing some other stuff.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
Let's just double check.

109
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,890
Oh, I'm missing these these styles right here for first child and last child relative within.

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,590
Side of our directory item container, but I think this is it as far as this large, I actually believe

111
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,580
this is not being used anymore, so we actually don't need this styling.

112
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,510
So let's just clear out that old CIUSSS.

113
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,860
And now let's import this and use it in our directory item component.

114
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,410
So here I'm going to import.

115
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,000
From our directory item styles.

116
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,500
And now what we need is the background image.

117
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,820
We need the body and we need the directory item container.

118
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,980
So here at the top level, we're going to get rid of the container.

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,230
For background image, we are going to get rid of this device while making sure to pass the actual image

120
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,420
your value still through.

121
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,820
And then for the body, let's just get rid of the do.

122
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,260
And.

123
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,470
It looks like perhaps.

124
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,320
There is a bit of an issue here.

125
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,880
Oh, oh, I'm missing a opening tag.

126
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,500
There we go.

127
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,930
OK, let's go back to our application.

128
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,010
Let's go to the homepage and there we see we have everything working.

129
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,050
We can also capitalize these titles if we want very easily with a little bit of CSI magic.

130
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,870
We can just go to the H2.

131
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,450
Which is actually inside of the body and here we can say, Tex transform uppercase.

132
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,880
And now if we save this and we come back.

133
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,370
We should see that all of our titles are now uppercase, cased.

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,380
OK, so this component, the primary thing I want you to realize is that you can pass whatever props

135
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,470
you want into these style components.

136
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,110
This gives you a lot more power in deciding what rules you want to generate inside of these components.

137
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,150
You can even determine if you want to add additional styling here and there by using this pattern.

138
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,050
So this is another great benefit that we get with style components.

139
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,930
You can treat them like components and they can receive props.

140
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,980
So now after this, the last thing we need to start is going to be actually one of the more complicated

141
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,110
components, maybe the most complicated one, which is our form input, and we'll do that in the next

142
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,440
video.
