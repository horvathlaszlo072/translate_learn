00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,340
So in this video, let's actually learn a little bit more about some styling facts with an react.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,770
And also, let's add the image.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,450
So what I want you to do is go into your resource folder.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,860
Get the categories JSON file inside is just an array of JSON, and I want you to paste that in place

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,690
of your current categories array.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,910
All that really changes is that you'll notice now we have this image URL field and it points to a special

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,670
place where I'm hosting all of the images that we need for our respective different categories.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,170
So once you have this in, I want you to also structure off the image URL because we're going to leverage

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,340
this and it's a strength.

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,970
What I want you to know is that when you are trying to append, let's say, some additional cases,

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,720
that's dynamic.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,880
You can actually do that in react by passing it as a style object.

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,740
So on any different component in your GSX, you can actually append custom styles by giving it this

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,700
style field.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,420
This Darvill takes an object where the key is the CIUSSS property that you want to modify.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,020
So in our particular case, I want background image.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,900
So with background image, the value that we need to pass, it is going to be a string of Earl and in

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,070
the brackets is the actual U R L string value.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,660
So here I'm going to use object restructuring, so I want to use the back picks.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,390
And with the object restructuring, I'm going to pass in image URL.

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,800
If you're unfamiliar with restructuring, all this is really doing is it's just allowing us to use a

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,930
string variable inside of another string.

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,980
And this is essentially what will happen is that we will apply a customs style on to this specific HDMI

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,340
element.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,350
So if we save this now?

27
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,200
And we go back to the application.

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,590
We'll see that now we have our images loading in.

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,380
And that's pretty much it as far as why it's all working stylistically.

30
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,830
Of course, it's because I'm already pre-written the styles for you to keep that in mind, but just

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,520
really focus on the fact that all we really did if we now inspect this image.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,410
Is we now have appended this style property and inside, as you remember.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,970
You can actually do this in any demo element.

34
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,310
You can pass it as a strength.

35
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,550
But for us with React React allows us to pass it a JavaScript object, and it will convert it all for

36
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,340
us, both from Camel case, which is how we should rate it inside of the JSON object over to the kabob

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,740
case, which is how it actually gets interpreted.

38
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,630
When you're writing rightthere more.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,850
So that's the great thing about React as well, is that it will essentially handle all of this for us.

40
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,680
So now that we have all of this code working.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,980
What we want to do now is really just start moving what is in, it's appropriate one file to its own

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,730
separate component.

43
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,820
So what we know is that we are really just using a category item here.

44
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,880
So what we can do is go and create our components folder.

45
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,330
And just like we did before.

46
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,980
I want to make another folder where we have our category item.

47
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:38,940
Category item is going to be a component, so it needs both a component, Duchess X-File.

48
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:49,810
And it also needs a style file, so category item dot styles, dot s6's.

49
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,000
So here, let's just go into our staff.

50
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:02,470
Let's cut out all of the styling that we had, and let's paste it into category item dot styles that

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,860
says.

52
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,820
Inside of category item, let's import in our style file.

53
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,850
Let's initialize our category item as a functional component.

54
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,130
And let's just remember to export by default out the category item.

55
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:34,340
As far as what we're going to receive, we are probably going to receive the entire object as a prop.

56
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,800
So here we can do.

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,200
Let's call it a category.

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,260
And that'll be the namespace that we do, and in turn, we just want to return all of that HTML that

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,250
we had from before.

60
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,890
So let's just close these folders.

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,760
Let's go here.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,660
Let's copy this email that we've been using.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,400
Let's paste this in here.

64
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,040
And now we remember that we cannot use the ID here.

65
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,360
We need to put it in the place where we actually call the map.

66
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,550
So will remember to do that when we go back to our app?

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,050
But we know that we need the image URL.

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,850
So here we can restructure here or we can restructure directly in the actual prop.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,920
It's entirely up to you, whatever you prefer.

71
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,240
We need the image URL and we need the title.

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,630
So here we've pretty much converted this over into its own component.

73
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,220
Let's save this.

74
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,680
Let's go back to our Angus.

75
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:42,520
Let's import in the component that we need from our components folder.

76
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,640
In our category item and our category item component.

77
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,730
That's copy the category item.

78
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,100
Let's paste this in.

79
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,810
And now we know that we need to actually pass the entire category.

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
So here we can do key is equal to category ID.

81
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,640
And category is equal to category.

82
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,740
And now, if we save and let's go back to our application, we see that everything is still working

83
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,820
as we expected to.

84
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,220
Awesome.

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,200
So everything still working, and we've pretty much started suffering out of our different components.

86
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,670
What I want you to do is I want you to actually even move this component, which is the entire categories.

87
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,550
Into its own component, so you can make this category menu, you can call it directory.

88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,080
Call it whatever you want, but essentially it should not all live within an OPG's.

89
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,920
And you also want to move the style that we had here for this categories, so you can move this also

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,670
into your own component.

91
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,750
That's my challenge to you.

92
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,430
So do that.

93
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,310
And then in the next video, we'll do it together.
