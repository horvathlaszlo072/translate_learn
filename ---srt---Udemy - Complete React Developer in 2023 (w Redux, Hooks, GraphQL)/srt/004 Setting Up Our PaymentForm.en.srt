00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,570
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,240
In this video, we're actually going to start coding out our check out form.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,900
So this is pretty much just going to be a very simple form.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,250
You can update it if you want.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,860
I'm just going to make it so that all it shows is the credit card input and then a button that allows

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,640
us to submit.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,630
So what we need to do is go into our components and I'm going to make a new folder and I'm going to

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,140
call this payment dash form because that's all this is for me.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,120
It's just a form that allows us to make a payment and we're going to embed this on our checkout page.

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,500
So here inside, I need this regular two files.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,590
I need payment, dash form, dot style such as X and I need payment form.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,230
Dot component, dot gsx.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,220
So inside of our components, let's set up what we need.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:02,190
We are going to first import in essentially this card element that I keep talking about that stripe

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,910
just gives us.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,100
So here I'm going to import in card element from.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:11,950
Dash.

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,520
React.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,110
Stripe.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,510
Jazz.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,940
This is pretty much the key component that will show what we actually want to show, which is that credit

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,480
card input.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,880
And then I'm also going to import our custom button because I need some button to actually make this

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,240
payment.

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,820
And that's it.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,660
Now, as for the component itself, I'm going to say payment form is equal to some component and then

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,690
I'm going to export it out as the default.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,520
So for now, all I want to do is just show the elements.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,830
I don't even care about it working or not.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,290
I just want to make sure that I can see what I want to see.

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,260
So I'm going to make a div and then inside of the div I'm going to place this card element.

32
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,750
And then I'm also going to place a button.

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,540
And inside of this button, I'm going to say pay now, for example.

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,480
And also I'm going to say button style or button type actually is going to be the inverted button.

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,380
So that's in as well are button types.

36
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,140
And here.

37
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm going to say this dot inverted.

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,210
And now with the payment form, we have to put it inside of our checkout component.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,430
So here I am going to import in our payment form from components.

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,380
Slash.

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,070
Payment form.

42
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,060
Payment form.

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,660
Component.

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,520
And I'll just embed this right here down at the bottom beneath the total.

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,340
So let's save this and let's go back to our application.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,270
And here we see it.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,570
It's a little squished because we have not defined the actual size incorrectly, but at least we see

48
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,710
the component is loading it.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,770
Now, what we can do now that we know it works is start actually making this look a little closer to

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,090
what we need it to look like.

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,660
So let's go back into our payment form component.

52
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,690
What we're going to want to do is we are going to want to create some kind of wrapping component as

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,800
well as a actual form, because this is going to be a submitted form.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,450
So we essentially want to say whenever this form submits, then perform the actual straight payment.

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,090
So for us to do this, we've got to go into payment form dot style, such as I'm going to import in

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,370
style from style components.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,950
And here I'm not going to do anything too fancy.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm just going to do a really simple container and then the form.

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,620
So let me say export const payment form container is equal to style octave.

60
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,780
And inside of this div, I'm going to say it has a height of 300 pixels.

61
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,050
I'm going to give it display flex.

62
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,580
I'm going to say flex direction.

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,140
Is column.

64
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,500
And then I'm going to make sure to align everything in the center.

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,120
So a line items center.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,790
As well as justify content censure.

67
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,930
Next.

68
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,640
What we need is the actual form.

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,990
So I'm an export consent form container which is equal to a styled form.

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,450
Inside.

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:45,050
I'm just going to say that this thing has a height of 100 pixels and a minimum width of, let's say,

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,830
500 pixels.

73
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,700
Now, what we want to do is we want to go into our payment form, component and import in both of these

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,200
new stock components that we created.

75
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:03,820
So I'm going to import this from payment form styles, our new payment form container as well as our

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,720
form container.

77
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:16,470
So here, I don't really need this anymore because now we've created our payment form container and

78
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,470
similarly we have our form container.

79
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,220
Which I need to make sure to wrap everything in.

80
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:35,670
And I'm also going to put an H2 and this H2 is going to say credit card payments like so.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,800
Now what we actually need to do in order to start interacting with this card element properly.

82
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,180
So the way that Stripe works is that you can actually pass this entire card element with all of the

83
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,510
appropriate data once it's filled in to stripe.

84
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,120
This is why this component is so easy.

85
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,560
In order for us to actually use it, though, we have to create a payment handler.

86
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,330
So this is something we're going to say that on submit for the form container, we want to pass this.

87
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:16,410
So I'm going to say const payment handler is equal to a async function because we need to make a API

88
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,510
request which is going to be asynchronous.

89
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:25,260
So first, what we do is prevent default because we don't want any of the typical form submission to

90
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,590
happen.

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,150
Now what we're going to do is we need to actually create a couple of things with Stripe in order for

92
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,690
this to work.

93
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,770
So this is where we need to start introducing a couple hooks.

94
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:47,520
From React strategies we need to import in the use stripe hook as well as use elements.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,860
So here we're going to get a Stripe instance from use stripe and this is what we're going to use to

96
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,340
actually make requests in the format that Stripe needs it to be.

97
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,470
And then we're going to bring in elements which is use elements.

98
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,620
So very similar hook pattern that we're used to.

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,540
Next.

100
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,800
What we're going to need to do is we need to actually first make sure that these two hooks are loaded

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,390
in when the payment handler fires.

102
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,350
So in order for that to work, I'm going to say if there is no Stripe instance or there is no elements

103
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,980
instance, in either case, I will just exit.

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,300
I don't want anything to happen.

105
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,940
So never proceed unless both of these are present.

106
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,880
Then what we're going to do is we need to make a fetch request to our back end in order to create a

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,990
payment intent.

108
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:50,410
And a payment intent is essentially something that Stripe creates so that it knows that, oh, there

109
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,970
is a payment coming.

110
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,140
And this payment intent is what Stripe uses to actually confirm that there is a final payment about

111
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,590
to happen.

112
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,900
So for us to do that, we need to now start talking about our net, the FY function.

113
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,830
So we're up to this point now where we need to actually make a request to the back end.

114
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,510
So we got to touch upon the back end.

115
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,430
So that's what we're going to do in the next video.

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,010
We're going to figure out how to create a strike payment intent with a network function.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
I see in the next video.
