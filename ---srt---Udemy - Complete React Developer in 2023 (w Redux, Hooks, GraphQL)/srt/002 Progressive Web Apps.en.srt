1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,900
Finally, let's finish off our talk with front end performance optimizations with progressive web apps.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,570
So what is a progressive Web app?

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:21,980
Well, a Web app is a website that allows users to interact with the Web page in many ways.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:33,780
However, whether it is a game, Twitter or Facebook, it is inside of a browser window such as Chrome,

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,880
Safari, Firefox.

6
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:44,930
A native app, on the other hand, is an app that is on a mobile phone like an iPhone or a Samsung.

7
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,000
That's what native means.

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,840
It's meant to work on a native platform like a mobile phone.

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,270
So do you ever wish that Web apps that live inside of browsers behave more like real apps on your phone?

10
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,110
Well, progressive web apps are a new technology that's aiming to make that happen, just like your

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,950
apps on your phone.

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,720
We want the user to have similar experience when visiting the Web.

13
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,630
But first, let's talk about the differences between the two.

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,000
To create a Web app, all you need to know is some HTML, CSFs and JavaScript, and you're good to go.

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:38,240
To create a native app that is a mobile phone app, you need to learn a native language like Java for

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,980
Android apps or Objective C and Swift for iOS apps.

17
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,380
Unlike viewing on the browser, native apps have all the files they need on the user's mobile phone.

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,890
For example, if you go into your phone and go through your apps, you can see how big some of those

19
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,160
phone apps are by looking at their file size.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:09,210
And that's because unlike the server client relationship that a Web app has, what has to go through,

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,260
request H.M. and finally get the CSIS and the JavaScript files.

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,490
You can download native apps and have them on your phone.

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,900
The files just living on your phone, the only thing you can really do with a Web app is maybe bookmark

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,530
a website.

25
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,870
Additionally, native apps can send you push notifications.

26
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,430
They can even work on flight.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,070
And you're never going to get a blank screen, for example.

28
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,420
If we go to GitHub and I have my wi fi turned off, if I refresh the page.

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,590
Well, I get this little dinosaur icon saying there's no Internet connection, you've never seen that

30
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,590
on a native app, have you?

31
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:10,230
Because native apps are built to work offline, maybe not have full functionality offline, but still

32
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,060
work and not get a blank screen.

33
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,340
Finally, with mobile apps or native apps.

34
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,580
You can find them to download in places like the App Store or the Google Play store.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,000
You can't really do that with Web apps.

36
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:37,140
Oh, and I almost forgot with native apps, they also have access to the phone hardware, like the camera

37
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,350
geolocation push notifications.

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,540
All right, I hope you get the point right now, our mobile apps and our Web apps are not really the

39
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,160
same thing.

40
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,360
And mobile apps tend to work nicer than Web apps on phones.

41
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:06,240
And this is where progressive web apps come in, you can now make Web apps behave like native apps.

42
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,770
What do I mean?

43
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:16,510
Well, with progressive web apps, you can make your browser not have that top URL bar.

44
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,880
So that the entire app covers the screen and looks like a mobile app, you can download them on your

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,180
phone and have a app icon on your phone home screen, they can work offline.

46
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,030
They can send push notifications on your iPhone.

47
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:43,020
And they also work a lot faster, just like on phones, a lot more than regular Web apps, because they're

48
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,010
designed with mobile in mind and there are a few other features of progressive Web apps, all in a goal

49
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,130
to make them a similar as possible to Native.

50
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,190
So think of progressive Web apps as web apps, but they behave more like native apps, don't worry.

51
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,270
It's a lot easier to implement than you think.

52
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,850
Like existing Web apps, they'll be hosted directly on their associated website.

53
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,650
Developers can update them directly on their Web server by deploying or updating their GitHub if it's

54
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:26,460
posted on GitHub pages, without submitting those updates to several different app stores, because

55
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:34,590
to update an app on the iOS App Store, you have to submit those changes and get those approved by Apple

56
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,510
with a progressive Web app.

57
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,620
You don't really need to do that.

58
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,610
And the best part of all, that same app is going to run on all browser platforms, that is if the phone

59
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,470
is using Safari, it's going to work on safari, it's going to work on Firefox, is going to work on

60
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:51,950
Chrome.

61
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,090
And you don't have to worry about it being built for Android or iOS or even Windows.

62
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,060
All right, so what's the goal of all of this?

63
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,460
Well, obviously better user experience, faster websites and we already know how important this is

64
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,900
from our previous videos.

65
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,320
Many people are really excited about progressive web apps.

66
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,190
And although it's fairly new, it's catching on fast.

67
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,620
And best of all, with new HTML5 APIs, we're starting to get more and more access to foreign hardware

68
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,990
that only native apps used to have.

69
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,410
If you go to.

70
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:43,220
What we can do dot today website, it shows you what you can do in a Web platform when you're building

71
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,640
your app and you see that we can do notifications.

72
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:55,980
We can do audio and video capture, we can do geolocation, so we're starting to get more and more power

73
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
with our Web apps.

74
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,340
Now, here's an interesting thing.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,360
Who do you think came up with the idea of progressive Web apps?

76
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,730
Give up, it was Google now.

77
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,750
Who do you think is the slowest in supporting this idea of progressive Web apps?

78
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,560
Give up its apple.

79
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,390
Because the goal is to make Webb feel like an app.

80
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,680
And you can look at the companies and their interest and see why they would have this stance.

81
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,800
Google, for example, has a big market share in the Web.

82
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:44,420
They're interested in their Chrome browser and their Google dotcom search results to be used as often

83
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,730
as possible while Apple has their closed ecosystem of the App Store.

84
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,300
And if you want to build an app, well, you have to build it the way that Apple wants it, using Objective

85
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:03,890
C or SWIFT and using their developer platform Xcode and submitting to their App Store to have an app.

86
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:13,960
So Apple is interested in keeping their dominance of apps on their phones, while Google is interested

87
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,800
in keeping their dominance on the Web.

88
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,910
And it's always good to think about these things when looking at technologies developed by these big

89
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,750
companies, it's often usually out of self-interest.

90
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,540
I know that sounds pessimistic, but it is true, although it benefits us.

91
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,100
It's good to understand the overarching goals.

92
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,930
Facebook, for example, has something called react native, and just like we learned, react, react

93
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,680
native is a way to build apps that work just like native apps.

94
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,730
So using react, you can now build iOS and Android apps, all with pretty much 90 percent of the code

95
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,620
being shared between those two platforms.

96
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,720
Anyway, let's get back on track.

97
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:13,330
Now, there is a constant battle with this, as Chrom has adopted this progressive webapp stance and

98
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,180
Apple that has the Safari browser has been really lagging in adopting these technologies.

99
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,930
But anyway, this is a constant battle, and as with everything that I've mentioned so far, we don't

100
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,410
want to pick a technology just because it's hip and cool and it's the latest craze.

101
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,830
We want to make sure that it adds value to our project.

102
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:44,840
Now, progressive web apps are going to evolve over time, but the main takeaway is this progressive

103
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:53,510
web apps do enhance the experience of our users, even if it isn't everyone like people with iOS.

104
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,750
If it is easy to implement, then we should consider it, though, because adding it to our project,

105
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,340
even if it helps just a few people, it still is beneficial.

106
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,680
And as time progresses, hopefully more and more adoption happens.

107
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,460
And this is exactly why create react app already comes preset with progressive web app capabilities.

108
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,070
Yeah, you heard me right.

109
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,810
They do it out of the box for you once again, create react app helps out a ton here with a little few

110
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,140
tweaks that I'm going to show you in the upcoming exercises.

111
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
We can have a progressive Web app pretty fast.

112
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,800
So I argue that because it is so easy, it's already set up and create react app.

113
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,710
We should implement progressive web apps abilities because it makes the user experience better.

114
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,740
And definitely improved performance.

115
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,120
But how can we make our robo friends up into a progressive Web app?

116
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,790
I mean, remember, that's what Bruno asked us to do.

117
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:08,330
Luckily for us, Google has created something called Lighthouse, and this lighthouse is a plug in a

118
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,090
chrome in that we can just install.

119
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,570
You can see it over here already have it installed and run it on any website and it'll tell us some

120
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,320
performance metrics and also how close we are to that progressive Web app.

121
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,880
And I have here for us our robo friends up with Redux already set up.

122
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,440
And I have a link to the website because, well, we need an actual URL.

123
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,680
So if I click on this, I can go to Lighthouse, plug in and say generate report.

124
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,880
And this is going to generate for us different reports, it's going to turn the app offline and then

125
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,910
online again to see if it has any offline capabilities, it's going to check if it has any other features

126
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,250
that a progressive Web app will have.

127
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,380
And we get a report back.

128
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,110
And as you can see, it gives us a few extra things like CEO best practices, accessibility, which

129
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,420
we're going to talk about, and also performance.

130
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,540
But the number that we were interested in is this progressive Web app, no, we see that although we

131
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,680
haven't done anything.

132
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,660
We have 82 percent.

133
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,600
I mean, it's green.

134
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,430
That's good, right?

135
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,370
If we scroll down to the progressive web app, it even tells you what we can do to fix this now.

136
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,180
How do we have 82 percent when we haven't done anything?

137
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,900
Well, like I said before, Creary ACTTAB sets everything for us so that it's easy to implement and

138
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,840
don't worry, we're going to go through this and get this to one hundred percent in our exercise.

139
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,360
But for now, that's enough talking for me.

140
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,040
I'll see you in the next video.

141
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,080
Bye bye.
