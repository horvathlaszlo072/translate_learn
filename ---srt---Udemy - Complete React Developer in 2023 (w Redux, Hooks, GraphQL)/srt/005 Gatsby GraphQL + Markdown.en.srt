1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,570
So with every Gaffey project, because Gatsby rules with graphic you all by default as its query language,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,600
you're able to actually access a graphical playground by going to localhost eight thousand.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,940
Underscore, underscore, underscore graphically.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,270
Well, this will load up this playground that shows us all of the queries we're able to make inside

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,740
of graphics.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:28,230
Well, now this is really good because we're actually able to do a lot of different things with this

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,940
graphical query list.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:37,720
For example, by default, we're actually able to access every single file inside of our directory.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,280
Now, when I say this, what do I mean?

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,950
So if you look inside of your Gatsby config, you'll see that there's this plug in here called Gatsby

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,960
source filesystem.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,680
Now, Gatsby source filesystem is a way for you to actually access the nodes that represent the files

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,550
inside of this directory with the name and the path.

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,240
The name just essentially allows us to tell Gatsby what it is that we want to put this under when we

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,870
query for it.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,470
Now, what are we calling for is actually going to be any files that lives inside this path that we

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:13,980
provide it.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,560
So here we see that we're string interpolating this directory name, which pretty much just represents

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,750
whatever the final directory structure is.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,770
And I want to go into our source folder and then our images folder.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,700
So right here.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,710
Now it's named images, because what it's trying to do is get all of the image files.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:38,100
Now, if we go back to our graphic, you all will see that what it is that we got is actually this thing

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,150
called all file.

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,290
Now, inside of this explorer, you'll see this list of all the different queries that we can access.

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,760
So if we wanted to actually see what that plugin was giving us, if I do all file and I hit command,

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,280
enter or control, enter, if you're on a windows, you'll see that automatically populates with these

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,200
properties of edges node and then the ID now edges represent the actual path to that file that we're

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,760
pointing to.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,050
So meaning that edges will be the array of the number of files that we have inside of our images folder.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,230
Now, inside of every edge will be a node and that node is the representation of what that file is.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,490
Now, the node Gatsby will convert for us.

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,460
But what that means is that if we look inside of this list, we'll be able to see what properties were

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,500
actually able to pluck off and look at.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,820
So if we do absolute path and if we do relative path as well.

36
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:45,570
If we hit enter again, we'll see that we're pointing to each of our image files and now by using this

37
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:52,370
query, we're actually able to get all of the files that we want inside of our project.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,760
So if we wanted to, for example, store different data inside of these files in order to actually represent

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,540
our blogs, we're able to do so using this all file query.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,440
Now, we're definitely going to explore that because this is really how it is that we're going to build

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,270
out our blogs.

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,040
There is a couple of things that we have to make sure that we do.

43
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,930
First, though, one thing is that while we're able to see a representation of our files, we cannot

44
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,360
actually get the data in those files.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,890
Yet in order to do so, we have to make some modifications to Gatsby.

46
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,770
And what we're going to write is going to be a little bit different than anything else you've probably

47
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,760
ever written before.

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,980
Now, what we want to do is we want to start actually building our blocks.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,520
There's a couple of things that we have to do in order to set this up.

50
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,350
The first is that we have to write the files that will hold the data of our blogs to begin with.

51
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,880
So these could just be individual blog posts with some text on them.

52
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,500
Now, the way that we can actually build out the blog content and get access to all the styling is to

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,940
use something called markdown.

54
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,470
Now, if you're unfamiliar with markdown, markdown is what is used to build.

55
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,890
Many of the read means that you see inside of GitHub.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
So you'll see that we have access to these different titles.

57
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,220
We got access to the static linking.

58
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,950
We can put all of these images inside and we also get access to these code blocks inside of markdown.

59
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:35,140
So markdown is a pretty consistently structured and very supported style of writing text that Gatsby

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,670
also allows us to use.

61
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,090
So if we wanted to write our blogs and get styling, you really just need to learn a little bit of markdown.

62
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,690
And I will give you a markdown cheat sheet that tells you all of the different styles you can apply

63
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,730
and markdown when you start writing your blogs.

64
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,980
But I have some pre written.

65
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:57,730
So what we're going to do is we are going to make a new folder that is going to hold all of our markdown

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,310
files that represent the blogs we're about to make.

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,520
So go back to your application and what you're going to do is make a new file inside of your source

68
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,840
or sorry, a new folder.

69
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,880
And we're going to call it markdown pages.

70
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,550
Inside of Mark Down pages is going to be each marked down file that represents each blog post you're

71
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,060
going to write.

72
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,610
So I'm going to make a new one and I'm going to call it ice cream and I'm going to kind of ice cream.

73
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,820
Dot M.D., now M.D. stands for markdown.

74
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:36,150
Now, inside of this, I'm just going to paste my markdown code that represents the first blog that

75
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm writing, and I am also going to give you this resource as well just so that you can walk through

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,500
with me before you actually make your own markdown files.

77
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,340
Now, you'll notice at the top here, there are these three dashes.

78
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,730
These three dashes represent what's called the front matter.

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,780
And the front matter is just kind of like some data that you can pull off of this markdown file and

80
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:05,460
have it represent perhaps some data that you want to display inside of a snippet rather than the entire

81
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,620
content of the actual blog itself.

82
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,620
This can also hold any metadata so you can just see the front matter as metadata and we're going to

83
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,880
explore how to actually use it inside of our graphical queries.

84
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,410
So other than this one, I actually also have another markdown file that I want to make and I want to

85
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,520
call it my first amay M.D. and similarily.

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,710
I have the other file here for you.

87
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:36,670
And here you'll see that I'm embedding an iFrame now this iFrame points to a YouTube link of the first

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:44,170
amay that I did a couple of weeks ago, but this thing is actually going to be what you get from YouTube

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,910
as an embed link so you can put this inside a markdown as well, because markdown ends up being computer

90
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,570
HTML.

91
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,050
And that's another great thing about using markdown.

92
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:00,460
Is that using these to markdown files, we're now able to represent our blogs very dynamically because

93
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,560
if we wanted to write new blogs, we simply just add new markdown files that represent our blogs.

94
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,930
And then after we write the remaining code that will dynamically build out our blog posts will be pretty

95
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,510
set in terms of our blog Web site.

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,220
Now, the one thing that we do have to do is we have to make sure that we're actually able to access

97
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,650
these markdown files, because as you remember inside of our config right now, all we're doing with

98
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,500
this file system is simply accessing images.

99
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,930
If we wanted access to markdown, we can just duplicate this block of code here.

100
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,060
So copy paste it down, except I'm going to change this name over to markdowns.

101
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,280
And instead of the path pointed to images, I'm going to point to our new markdown pages path.

102
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,860
So let's save this and what you have to do is you actually have to restart your server whenever you

103
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,480
change any plugins inside of your config.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,500
So while we get hot reloading with a lot of the metadata or into the files that we change inside of

105
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,490
our general structure, we do not get it with our config plug ins.

106
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,860
If you change the plugin, just restart your server.

107
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,260
And once it's finished building, we're going to go back to our graphics and we're going to take a look

108
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,490
at what it is that we get.

109
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,220
So if we refresh now and we enter, we still see our original image files.

110
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,430
But now we see that we also have our markdown files.

111
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,700
So now that we're able to access the node representation of these markdown files, let's actually figure

112
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,340
out how to pull the data out of them in order to dynamically build out the pages that we need inside

113
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,800
of our application to represent these blog posts.

114
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,650
And that's what we're going to do in the next lesson.

115
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,070
So I'll see you in that lesson.
