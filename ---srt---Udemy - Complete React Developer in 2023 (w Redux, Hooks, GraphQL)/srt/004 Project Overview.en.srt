1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,520
This is our final e commerce project, we're going to have navigation and routing.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,470
That takes us to different pages of categories of items and from these items, we're actually going

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,780
to be able to add them to our cart.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,880
And from our car, we're actually going to see these things directly update.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,680
And from this car, we're going to be able to check out increase or decrease these items again and see

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,950
the live changes in both our checkout page and our car page, remove items.

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,520
And actually integrate with a stripe API so that we can handle payments.

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,390
Now this is actually going to be a test version of Stripe because we don't actually have items to ship

9
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,390
and we don't actually want to process real payments because this is just a portfolio project.

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,130
But the matter of switching it is simply a change in the actual stripe website it you're going to actually

11
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,610
learn what it is to actually build using the stripe API.

12
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,050
And beyond that, we're also going to integrate with Firebase to handle our authentication and our storage.

13
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,550
So with Firebase, we're actually going to be able to authorize our users using Google so that we can

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,190
sign in with our Google accounts.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,090
And once we sign and we're also going to provide a sign of feature.

16
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,690
And a sign up and sign in with email and password feature, so it's going to be a really fleshed out,

17
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,200
fully complete e-commerce platform, just like you would build for a real e-commerce company.
