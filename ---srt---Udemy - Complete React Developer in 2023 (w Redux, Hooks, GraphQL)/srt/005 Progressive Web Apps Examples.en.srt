1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,380
Think of a progressive Web app, more like a running list of things you can do than a static list.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,440
It's going to evolve over time.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,880
But the idea is to make user experience, as we know, as close as possible to a native app.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,010
By the way.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,810
Maybe you don't trust me, maybe you think that this progressive Web app is just pure hype and I'm just

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,240
teaching us something that won't exist in two years.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,050
Well.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,580
Companies like Twitter.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,930
Have adopted progressive web apps, so much so that Twitter has moved all of their mobile Web traffic

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,750
to a react progressive Web app.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Alibaba, dotcom.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,500
Yeah, they use a progressive Web app, Lyft and Uber uses a progressive Web app.

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,940
Lyft, for example, has a goal of making their progressive Web app a hundred percent parody or have

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,140
complete feature set that their mobile phone has.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,460
Their mobile app has to be the exact same as their Web app.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:18,140
And there's tons of companies that are adopting progressive web apps because it is so beneficial.

17
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:26,960
Let me show you a few examples to really emphasize and make you understand what this is.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,430
One of the great examples that I like is this pogo index dot org website, a very, very simple website

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,570
that shows you Boeckmann information.

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,540
Everybody loves that.

21
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,540
Now, this is a progressive Web app.

22
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,590
Well, how so?

23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,280
If I go open up the developer tools.

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,940
And you see over here, if I click on the icon that shows toggle device toolbar.

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,960
And I scroll down here.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,050
Well, show me the mobile view of this app.

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,550
Let me scroll down so we can see it fully and we see over here that it looks pretty good on mobile,

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,870
I can even turn it around.

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,740
And we also have the menu that's working.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,050
But the cool part about this is if I turn off my wi fi.

31
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,410
Which usually gives us that blank page with the dinosaur on Chrome saying we don't have an Internet

32
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:35,890
connection.

33
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,170
Well, check this out.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,340
This still works.

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,460
How cool is that?

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,980
If I had this on my phone, even though I don't have an Internet connection, I'd be able to still check

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,070
out all these Pokemon's.

38
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,960
All right, let's turn back the Wi-Fi.

39
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,640
And take a look at another website, and this is the Hacker News, progressive Web apps.

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,330
And you can think of it as a playground where people try and rebuild the hacker news website using a

41
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,950
progressive Web app and you can see here, it gives us the lighthouse score.

42
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,320
It gives us some important metrics like how fast our Web page loads.

43
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,240
And you can even look at the code of people that have implemented this.

44
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,250
Now, let's click on The View app over here for one of the examples, and we see over here that we just

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,560
have a simple Hacker News website.

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,670
The cool part about this, and this is a thing that we'll talk about later on in the videos is if I

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,630
open this tab now, let's scroll this tab up now.

48
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,280
And we go to application.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,650
Scroll all the way up to what we call the manifest.

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,070
We see over here that there's a add to home screen button and this add to home screen button appears

51
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,390
for mobile users.

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,320
If I visited the site multiple times, it's going to have a pop up and you might have seen this while

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,760
browsing the Web as well that says, hey, do you want to add this to your home screen?

54
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,540
You see over here, if I click that, I get this little notification.

55
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,880
If I click on ADD.

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,310
I can add the application will keep the name the same.

57
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,580
And now on my desktop and now on my desktop.

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,390
Look at that, I have Prepacked Hacker News app.

59
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,980
Straight on this desktop and it.

60
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,590
Opens up right away if I turned off the Wi-Fi.

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,010
And open this up again, we see that it still works.

62
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,010
How cool is that and you still see the you are albar because this is a browser, but if we were on a

63
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,880
mobile phone, you actually wouldn't see this.

64
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,180
You are albar and it will feel completely like an app.

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,280
Very, very cool.

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,010
You see here that we don't completely have full features because you still need Wi-Fi for some parts.

67
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,390
But that's OK, right?

68
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,570
Good.

69
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,540
Because native apps work like that to.

70
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,030
There you go, starting to load now.

71
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,040
All right, so I think that's enough examples to prove to you that maybe we should consider doing this

72
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,420
whole progressive Web app thing.

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,440
In the next few videos, I'm going to show you the three most important parts to build our own progressive

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,030
Web app, and we're going to talk about these three topics so that our friends app is going to be a

75
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,370
progressive Web app by the end of this section.

76
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,090
And Bruno is going to love us for it.

77
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,960
I'll see in the next one.

78
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,070
Bye bye.
