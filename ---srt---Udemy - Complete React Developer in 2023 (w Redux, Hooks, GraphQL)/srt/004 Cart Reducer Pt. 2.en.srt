00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,590
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,130
So in the last video I talked about separating out this new function that will allow us to dispatch

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,100
the appropriate payload so that we can update our reducer with the correct value.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,270
So in this video, we're going to talk about how to actually generate those values.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,240
And also, let's think about where we're going to use this function.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,160
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write a little comment here so I know what I want to do

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,880
with this function.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,860
In the end, what I want to do is dispatch new action with payload that looks like this object.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,630
We should have new car items.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:45,140
We should have the new cart total, and we should have the new cart count.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,830
Once we're inside, though, we need to figure out how to get these values.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,520
As I mentioned, the actual optical items reducer.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,050
This is a generic function that should already be receiving the new car items hint, hint, nudge,

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,380
nudge.

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,150
That kind of tells us where we're going to use this.

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,460
But in the interim, we need to figure out how to get the new car total and the new car count from the

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,180
new car items.

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,580
So that's really another thing we need to get.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,700
We need to generate new heart total and we need to generate new heart.

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,520
So utilizing these three things, let's actually build out this function.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,140
So first we have to figure out how to get these new items into update cart items reducer.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,820
So here we already have these three different helper functions that explicitly, as we know, give us

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,560
the new cart items.

24
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:47,210
So here, instead of setting them, let's just cast them to a variable called new car items inside of

25
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,720
the function.

26
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,780
And similarly.

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,640
We're going to do that in each of these areas like so.

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,410
So now that we have the new card items, let's just also run our function, passing them through.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,510
And we can pass this to each of our three functions.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,470
And now the card items that we receive we know will be the correct card items because we've already

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,990
made sure that our functions do exactly that.

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,630
They give us the new array for what these cards should be.

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,560
Then we want to do is we want to generate the new car total and the new car using these new card items.

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,640
And luckily for us, we kind of already have the code that does that.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,340
So here we can actually just copy this from our effects, because what they do is they work off of car

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,300
items changing whenever it changes to the newer car times that we need.

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,540
So instead of reducing over car items, we now can just reduce over the new car items that were getting

38
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,480
in to get the new car count and the new car total.

39
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,970
Now that we saw these two, the last thing we need to do is dispatch the new action with the appropriate

40
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,450
payload.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,360
So here, what I want to do is instead of using all of these values.

42
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,690
I am going to.

43
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,590
Figure out how to use use reducer to help us do this.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,830
So first, let's think about use reducer.

45
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,400
User reducer, as we know, is where we're going to get the actual dispatch that we need.

46
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,330
So to do that, I know that I get state and I get what's dispatch like, so.

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:47,260
And then from use reducer I need to pass it both our cart reducer as well as our initial state.

48
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,180
As for dispatch.

49
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,300
Now we can actually just dispatch away the new action that we want to generate.

50
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,430
The type here is going to be set car items as a string.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,500
And the payload is going to be an object where car items.

52
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,430
Is new car items.

53
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,250
Where the cart total is the new cart total.

54
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,930
And the cart count.

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,360
Is going to be new cart count.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,040
And that's it.

57
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,220
That's all we really need.

58
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,740
Now we can get rid of this.

59
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,290
But here we actually noticed that we need our car items from our new use reducer.

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,950
So to do that, we can strip off cart.

61
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,430
Items.

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,690
In fact, we know that we have to pass both items car count, cart total and is cart open all through

63
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,550
into our context value.

64
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,110
So let's actually structure off all those values that we have anyways.

65
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,970
So we also need card count and we also need cart total.

66
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,770
Now, if we save this, we see that our warnings are gone, but we still have set.

67
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,970
Is carp open?

68
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,220
So this is going to be a new function that we have.

69
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,850
But we'll figure that out after we finish cleaning up what we have inside of our car provider.

70
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,600
So we finished setting up our method.

71
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,100
We finished setting up our action, create our functions, if you want to call them that.

72
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,680
And we finished setting up this reducer that has set items.

73
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,300
Let's just make sure to test that all of this is working.

74
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,740
And the best way is to just quickly make sure for now this is always going to be true.

75
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,330
Because by doing this now, technically, it's unstoppable, which is perfectly fine.

76
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,170
Oops.

77
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,890
Actually.

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,430
Sorry.

79
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's just set an empty function.

80
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,000
And let's set is cart open to true by default.

81
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,990
Because I want to be able to see the car to make sure that all of my methods here are working now that

82
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,980
we've converted them over.

83
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,690
So.

84
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:14,890
Yep.

85
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,560
We see our cart.

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,820
Let's go into shop.

87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,170
We add items.

88
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,300
We see that everything works.

89
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,410
We go to our checkout.

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,750
We see that our remove item works.

91
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,910
And we see that a clear item works.

92
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,860
So all our code is still working.

93
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,320
But now we need to make sure that we do our is card open.

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,370
So here before if you remember we had a center function that we were using with you state.

95
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:46,310
Now instead we need to create and dispatch a new action that will set the actual is cart open value.

96
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,490
So here I'm going to flip this back to false.

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,930
And this is going to be my challenge to you.

98
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,120
I want you to update this cart reducer and create a set is cart open method.

99
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:06,040
That is going to be a function that will update our card reducer with the appropriate value for our

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,310
card.

101
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,510
So do that for me and then join me in the next video where we will tidy up this car context as well

102
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,960
as figure out some minor optimizations and utility functions that will make modifying our reducers easier

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680
in the long run.

104
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,180
I'll see you in the next video.
