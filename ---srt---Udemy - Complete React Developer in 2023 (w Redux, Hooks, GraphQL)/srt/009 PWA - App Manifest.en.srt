00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:10,830
Let's talk about the second point of making a progressive Web app and probably the cutest little icon

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,000
that I'm going to have in discourse, the app manifest.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:24,080
Now, for a progressive Web app to behave like a native app, we need to mimic not just the function

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,340
of a native app, but also some of the views that we get with it or the shell.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,270
For example, on your phone, you can download an app and have an app icon on Android devices.

7
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,550
You have things such as splash screens.

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,810
The idea is to make the Web app as indistinguishable.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,980
As possible to a real mobile app.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,150
And we can do that with the app manifest before we get into it, though, the one thing I do want to

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,630
point.

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:08,020
Is that a lot of people forget to include in their index file this line over here and this comes out

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,490
of the box with a react up, you can see that I'm in the public index folder.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,020
And this line, which is the meta tag with viewport, optimises the app for multiple devices.

15
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,390
And this might seem super obvious, but a lot of people forget it.

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,750
And this line helps with adjusting the screen size based on the device.

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,330
So this is a must and it will warn you if you're missing this line in the Lighthouse report.

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,060
So now that we have the screen set up for mobile devices, let's talk about the app manifest file.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,290
And as you can see in our public folder, again, this is something that we get for free from Creative

20
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:54,830
Reactive.

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,290
And this is it, this is the manifest Dodgson file.

22
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,120
It's a simple JSON file that gives the developers the ability to control how the app should appear to

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,360
the user in areas where they would expect to see apps such as the mobile device homescreen.

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,860
And just define how the app is going to launch and how it's going to look.

25
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:29,230
So if you remember in my example over here with this Hacker News app, we had the add to home screen

26
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,210
button in the application tab.

27
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,600
And you might have noticed that we actually clicked on this thing called Manifest and the application,

28
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,900
and that's the manifest dot JSON file.

29
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,520
The browser reads this and spits out this little piece of information for us, and if I scroll down,

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,570
you see that I have icons here that get downloaded.

31
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,240
Just like I did for when I downloaded it onto my home screen, and this is the icon that you'll see

32
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,890
when you download this app on your mobile phone, and it also gives us this nice little feature to add

33
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,240
to homescreen.

34
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,630
So this is the app manifest fall and what it does.

35
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,160
Now, how do we generate these icons?

36
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,580
We see over here that create react AB has generated a Vatican.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
In the public folder.

38
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,800
But we're missing a few things, aren't we?

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,140
We don't have all these other sized icons for mobile phones because we still need to generate them for

40
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,710
our app.

41
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,170
And you can see here that they have different sizes.

42
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,320
Based on whichever device this gets downloaded on.

43
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,100
Luckily for us, there's a great tool that does this very nicely and easily.

44
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,420
It's called real.

45
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,930
Taddiken generator.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,850
And this all we need to do is provide an image.

47
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:13,610
Such as an image of a robot by just clicking on Select Fabricant picture and it will take you through

48
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:21,530
the steps to download these and all we need to do is include them in our public folder, just like the

49
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,580
fabric on icon laws and reference them in the manifest DOT JSA.

50
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,140
And don't worry, this is exactly where we're going to do in our exercise to turn our robo friends up

51
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,720
into a progressive web app.

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:46,160
Another thing that this website does for us is previewing and customizing the splash screen for our

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,910
manifest file.

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
Now, what is a splash screen?

55
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,990
In older versions of Chrome for Android tapping on the home screen, icon for an app would often take

56
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:06,730
up to a couple of hundred milliseconds before that screen gets loaded, a user would see a white screen.

57
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,170
Which makes the experience a little bit jarring and it looks like the website is loading really slow,

58
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,400
so Chrome forty seven and above support this idea of a splash screen.

59
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,640
Where you can add a background color when you tap on the app, the progressive Web app, instead of

60
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,540
loading the white screen, it's going to load something called a splash screen.

61
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,650
Where l have the background color, the name and icon of the web, and it will get that all from our

62
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,360
manifest JSON file.

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,580
And this is all done simply to make your webapp feel a lot closer to what you see with native apps when

64
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,860
you click on native apps, even if they're loading, they have some sort of a background and icon to

65
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,150
show you that it is loading.

66
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,270
Overall, though, that's it, that's pretty simple, right?

67
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,590
All we need is some icons and add them to manifest that JSA.

68
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,140
That's it for now.

69
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,410
I'll see you in the next one.

70
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,540
Bye bye.
