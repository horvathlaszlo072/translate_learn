00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,660
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,940
And the last video we set up some of the base structure for application in this video, we are going

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,220
to expand upon that and actually transform this to look closer to what we have in our final product.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,540
We're just going to build upon some of those concepts that we learned in Monster's Rolodex in order

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,540
to actually flesh this out before again, we start components using even just this directory to begin

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:22,780
with.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,950
What we want to do is just apply some basic styling while also abstracting out the work that we need

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,250
to do.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:38,590
So as we can see here, notice how essentially all of these components are duplicated five times.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,520
We hardcoded this at first because it was the easier thing to do.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,760
But as we scale, this definitely doesn't make sense.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,020
Essentially, we're repeating the same code here where these values, where it's pretty much just the

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,010
H2S are the only places where it's essentially different.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,350
Maybe the image is different, but we haven't even tackled that yet, but we can already tell that this

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,250
value is going to be repeated just using a different value.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,940
So this is a good place for us to actually start optimizing a little bit.

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:18,610
So instead of hard coding out these four other sections, what we can do is we can actually initialize

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,370
some variable array and I want to call this thing the directories or the categories.

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,750
And this is going to be an array that contains objects that reflect what it is that we have in here.

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,220
So to begin with, let's just start with one.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,580
Let's just figure out the shape of whatever it is that we want to display.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,790
We know for sure that we have a title value.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,240
This title is going to be hats because that's essentially what we're going to display for us.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,070
Just the hat.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,880
And then we know that there is also a subtitle and the subtitle here is Shop Now.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,500
But let's think about this.

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,520
Every single one of our different categories is also going to say Shop now.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,130
So technically you don't actually need to pass this.

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,800
This value can actually be hard coded, so you actually don't even need a subtitle because you know

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,940
that shop now is going to be present in every single one of your categories.

31
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,720
So that's a good way to determine what values you need and your object versus which ones you don't.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,740
I'm also going to initialize an ID just so that it's more clear.

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,470
And let me just start using these categories here.

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,480
So we know that inside of our categories container, we're going to map over the categories.

35
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,640
So remember, Rapidan, you are.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,160
Squiggly brackets then say categories that map and you're going to parse it a function where you get

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,940
the category.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,560
And then what you're going to do is you are now going to copy this through.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,090
So actually, let's do a single line return of our.

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Jess sexier.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,290
And inside, let's make sure to use this tidal value.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,330
So instead of taking category, let's just destructor this off completely.

43
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,600
And then inside of here, we'll just render title.

44
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,800
So so far, what we're doing is we're just setting up our codes, so it's easy to add these objects

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,690
into our categories and then have react, of course, reflectively generate multiple dips.

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,280
So let's save this and just make sure it's working for just our one object so far, which is our hats.

47
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,460
And we see that it's working now, if we were to duplicate this.

48
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,740
Let's say the five times to three, four and five.

49
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,530
Let's remember what we had, we had hats, jackets, sneakers.

50
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,660
Women's.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,450
And men's, let's save this.

52
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,800
Let's go back to our application, and we see just like that, we have replicated this behavior very

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,090
quickly, very easily.

54
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:06,730
So just to recap, what we did is we took and went from our hardcoded GSX over to a more dynamic and

55
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,130
reusable version of our GSX.

56
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,260
And this is going to reflect our catÃ©gorie component that we're eventually going to use.

57
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,010
But before we start migrating out into a components folder and doing all of that code, let's just make

58
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,280
sure that everything we want here in one file makes sense.

59
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,170
This is a good way to practice writing your react because it gets complicated once you start navigating

60
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,460
and making multiple files.

61
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,010
When you're working in the beginning, just do it all in one file when you're getting used to the way

62
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,350
that react is written and the way that the code works.

63
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,190
Now what are the great advantages is that we can now easily modify all of our components in one place.

64
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,890
So let's say we wanted to actually use an image.

65
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,530
And in our particular case with this background image, we can use a div and I'll show you how the styling

66
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,610
works for a background image.

67
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,940
But as far as the idea goes, it's very easy to set this up because now we can just apply it in one

68
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,120
place, and all five components will reflect this change.

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,960
So this is one of the main advantages of writing.

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,360
Our code and react is that it becomes very simple.

71
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,750
You essentially have data that becomes your UI.

72
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,710
And all we need to do now is just apply what we want to call this.

73
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
So let me say, I call this background I'm just for now.

74
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,480
It doesn't actually have an image because we haven't given anything, nor are we told how it can be

75
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,140
a background image.

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,100
But as far as the idea goes, it's very easy to reflect this across all of our different HTML components,

77
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,890
the five different categories that are now reflected here.

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:45,750
So now that we understand the setup of how to convert our data in JavaScript into our GSX UI, we can

79
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,230
now actually start styling this component, which we'll do in the next video.

80
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,900
We're going to learn about SAS.

81
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,050
We're going to learn about how to add that into react, and we're going to learn about how to actually

82
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,800
start making this look the way we want it to in our final result.

83
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,050
So let's do that in our next video.
