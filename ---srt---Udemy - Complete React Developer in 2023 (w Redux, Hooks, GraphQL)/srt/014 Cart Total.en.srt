00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,620
So let's set the total inside of our cart provider.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,340
So first, let's make a new value of total, which by default is zero.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,250
And this is going to be very similar to the count.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:22,210
Essentially, it's almost the same thing, except what we're doing is we're really just changing the

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,740
value of the.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,830
Total price, by accumulating it rather than the quantity, it's arguably pretty much the exact same

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,320
code as the actual count.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,790
So what we're going to do is we can duplicate this use effect.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,100
Some of you may be wondering, why don't we just put both effects into the same effect?

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,730
Typically, one of the best practices when using use effect is to make sure that it just governs one

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,170
singular responsibility.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,600
You can have a multiple use effects running.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
It's kind of like how you want your functions to be single responsibility.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,680
You want the same thing for your use effect so that it's not so convoluted and difficult to read here.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Inside of this use effect, what we're going to do is we're going to say new cart total is equal to

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,750
reducing over our car items, and we're just going to add the total value equal to the cart item quantity

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,810
multiplied by the cart item price.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,800
And this is pretty much it.

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,940
Once you have that, you can just set the new cart total by calling set cart total.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,330
And then we can just pass this car as the value, so actually, instead of total up here, I need to

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,110
also update this to cart total.

23
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,950
So that's a lot more clear as to what this value represents.

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,210
And then we can just attach this over onto the value.

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:57,140
And inside of our checkout component, we can just pull off the cart total and then render it right

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,060
here like so and we can just put a little dollar sign so that we're much more clear about the fact that

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,040
this is in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars or whatever currency you want it to be in.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
So let's save this.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,700
Let's go back.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,230
We have zero dollars.

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,600
Let's add some items.

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,490
Come back, go to check out.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,790
Scroll down.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,860
There's our total if we add two more grey brooms, this total should increase by 50 dollars, which

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,210
it does to two twenty four.

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,560
If we get rid of this issue reduced by $70 to one for which it also does so everything is working with

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,040
our total.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,700
So there we go.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,390
We have pretty much the majority of the complex features that we need built in based on our cart.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,910
It's already looking really good.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,250
So now what we need to do is we've primarily done this for a bunch of our hats.

42
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,170
But what about all of our other actual data?

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,440
In fact, this is all still hardcoded into our system.

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,280
What we want to do is we want to figure out how to improve this structure by adding more items into

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,410
our overall project, but also figuring out how to fetch them from a back end.

46
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,630
So we're going to move on to the next section, which is where we need to work with fetching data from

47
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,180
a backend in order to populate our website.

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,750
But before we do that, let's first commit our code.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,340
So go back to your terminal.

50
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,990
And then what you're going to do is just add your changes and what we're going to say is created checkout

51
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:43,920
page along with checkout items and checkout cart functionality, and then just push this up.

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,230
And now join me in the next video where we're going to start working more with product data.

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,760
I'll see you in the next video.
