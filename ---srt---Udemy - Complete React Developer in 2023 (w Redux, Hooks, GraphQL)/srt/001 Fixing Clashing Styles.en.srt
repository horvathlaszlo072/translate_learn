1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,610
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,620
And the last video we discovered that we seem to have this styling clash.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,460
And what you would notice if you look inside of the category container is you see that we have both

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,730
styling coming from our category dot styles that says, but we also have styling coming from our category.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,540
Item dot styles our category item, if you remember, is what we named these components.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,380
So this is actually an unfortunate side effect that does happen very frequently when we write season

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,920
sass.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,860
The reason being that if we forget the name ining and the nomenclature of these components, it's very

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,800
easy to accidentally write the same class names for specific elements that you might have forgotten

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,060
about for some time now.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,330
This is also a very common problem in general.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,480
Web development when you're writing CC and Sass, CSI is present across the entire page.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,370
If you're not super diligent with your strategy, it's very easy to find these clashes.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,040
So for us, this is actually a two fold problem that we can solve.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,070
The first is solving this immediately.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,570
The next is figuring out if we can solve it using something in the React ecosystem.

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,640
And I'm going to talk about that later.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,040
First, let's just fix this with the first solution, which is just to resolve this conflict.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,680
So back inside of our component, we have this category item component.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,150
This component is what we use to demonstrate on the main page.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,320
These five different selectable options.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,070
What these are is instead of calling them category item, we can call them directory item because they

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,950
are housed in the directory component, if you remember.

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
So let's start renaming these.

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,320
I want to rename this to directory item.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,880
And similarly, the code inside this should be directory item component.

27
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,320
And also directory item dot styles.

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,760
For this directory item, of course, we need to update all references to this, so let's focus on our

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,930
internal files first.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,170
Directory item like so.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,340
And then instead of category container, this should be directory item container.

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,420
And instead of category bottom container, we'll call this directory item body container.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,210
In fact, let's just call it directory item body.

34
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,730
So now let's save this and inside of our directory item styles, let's remember what we change this

35
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:37,940
to.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,270
This is now directory item container.

37
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,070
And similarly, it's just now body.

38
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,870
If I remember correctly that we just call a body.

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,370
Now we call it directory item body, no, let's call it body body is pretty clear because it's housed

40
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,750
under directory item container, so it's the body of the directory item.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,820
And let's see if anywhere else we might have this.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,620
Yes, we do.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,030
Let's fix this here as well.

44
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,790
And now, if we save this, we need to now make sure that we're leveraging the new item in the correct

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,030
place, which will be inside of our directory component.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,480
So here now, this is no longer a category item.

47
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,180
This is a directory item which we can now save and now we come back.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,020
Let's see.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,250
Our component is now working.

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,280
And now if we navigate to slash shop slash hats.

51
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,330
We also see that our shop page is working.

52
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,840
So what about the other roots?

53
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,920
Well, here if we go to shop jackets.

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
We see that it also works.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,610
The last thing we need to do that we seem to miss with our collection preview is we did not make these

56
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,460
clickable links to take us to the appropriate place so you can actually leverage the link component

57
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,490
we get from Rotterdam to switch this over.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,600
Let's actually do this quickly together.

59
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,620
Go to the navigation component.

60
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,760
Pause the video and try and figure out how to leverage this link component and use it inside the category

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,750
preview component.

62
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm going to give you a second to try yourself.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,460
And now let's do it.

64
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:31,500
So what we need to do is import in link from React Rotterdam and then what we're going to do is we're

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,400
going to replace this span with Link and then the two is going to take us to title.

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670
Because we're using title as our roots.

67
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,540
If I save this now, if I click hats, it does take me two hats.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,730
Inside of this page, we can also render the title up here as well, since we haven't done that.

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:03,030
So let's go into our category component and at the very top, before any of this, we can render a H2

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,770
where we just show the actual category.

71
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,730
And we can give this a class name of title.

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,520
Now, similarly, we are going to want to stall this title, so inside a category styles, we can target

73
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,170
title.

74
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,660
And let's just take the same font that we've been using throughout the other parts of our application.

75
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,140
So inside of our category preview.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,310
Component right here.

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,600
Let's take this font size.

78
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,980
And let's just put this inside of here.

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,220
In fact, let's increase it to 38, and now if we save this, we come back.

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,670
Now we see that our hats is being rendered in the wrong place.

81
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,080
Of course it is because it's a grid.

82
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:05,240
So now let's go back to our category component and let's move this above, which means that if we're

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,110
going to do that, then we want to wrap this in a fragment.

84
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,470
And now we can say fragment.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,100
Fragment.

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,140
Let's paste this in like so and then move the div below it.

87
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:28,870
Save.

88
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,790
Come back to our application.

89
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,250
And now we see hats up here.

90
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,710
So what we can also do is to upper case, we need to call the method like so.

91
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,210
And here we see hats.

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,090
So you can further stall this if you want if you want to center this more, if you want to make this

93
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,540
bigger.

94
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,200
All you need to do is because this is no longer inside of the category container.

95
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,810
You can say title like so.

96
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,570
But the problem with this, of course, is that now any of our other titles might inherit this style

97
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,520
if they have this class name of title.

98
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,940
So here we actually need to be more explicit.

99
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,210
We need to call this something like category title.

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,060
But again, this is assuming that we can properly remember that this is called category title.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,280
This becomes that same problem where we're getting these styling clashes that keep happening.

102
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,030
So this is actually what's going to bring me towards my next topic.

103
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
But before that, let's finish up styling.

104
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,870
What we need to stop.

105
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:38,400
So category title, I'm also going to add a text align center here, and then I'm going to update the

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,980
corresponding component in our category component so that its category title.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,730
And now let's save come back and there we go.

108
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,270
This is pretty much it.

109
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,630
We built our entire application.

110
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,420
There's a couple of things that we're missing, such as the checkout or not the actual checkout, but

111
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,590
the payment step, but we can discuss that in a later video.

112
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,130
It's not the most pressing thing right now because it's just an additional feature.

113
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,400
What I do want to do is take a second and really congratulate you because you've built a rather complicated

114
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,050
React application that utilizes a lot of the modern technology and a lot of the complex base of what

115
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,100
React has to offer in the next video we're going to discuss.

116
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,140
The first thing I mentioned at the beginning of this video, which is that there is this styling clashing

117
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,370
problem that we keep seeing.

118
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:38,410
The styling clashing issue comes from the fact that we are relying on CIUSSS to style these individual

119
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:44,230
components and thinking about how we named their classes may not be the most accurate option.

120
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,640
What we're going to do is talk about CIUSSS in J.

121
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,490
S Solutions, so that's what we're going to do.

122
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,560
And we're going to talk about that in the next video.

123
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,660
But until then, take a quick breather.

124
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,670
Appreciate the work that we've done.

125
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,840
You've come a long way and you've really built something great now.

126
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,390
You've learned a lot about React, and that is no easy feat to pat yourself on the back and then join

127
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,380
me in the next video.
