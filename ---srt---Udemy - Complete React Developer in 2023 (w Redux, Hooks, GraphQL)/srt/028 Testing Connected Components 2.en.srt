1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,040
And you can already start to see some things that we can clean up here, we can just copy and paste

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,790
this, let's just create one more instance and says filters robot correctly to.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,520
We'll say that the will say three for now just to keep this clean.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:35,220
I will say that the concert filter or filtered robots.

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:45,610
Should equal an empty array, and this time we're searching for the letter, which doesn't exist in

6
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,950
name, and we expect the filtered robots to.

7
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,730
He called the.

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,750
Dummy filtered robots that we gave it.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,730
Let's save.

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,460
And we see that something is failing.

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,100
Because Mark, props to is not defined, we need to give it three.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,410
And there you have it, we've now tested our main page, at least the main page method of filtered robots.

13
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,390
And we also have some snapshot testing as well, so let's just look at our code coverage for now.

14
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,400
Let's just run NPM run test dash, dash.

15
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,670
Dash dash coverage.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,620
And again, this is always with testing, there's always many more things they can do.

17
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:56,860
We see that main page has a hundred percent, but there is a branch percentage.

18
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,810
We're only testing 50 percent of the branch.

19
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,460
And you see that the uncovered line is on 28 if we go back.

20
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:14,180
We can go to main page and see that we have a is pending on line twenty eight.

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,800
How cool is that?

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,350
The test says, all right, we're testing that the card list is rendering because we're always testing

23
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,480
with spending is true.

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,670
As you can see here in our.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,660
In our mock props, we always have is pending default, so we might want to test is pending to true

26
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,140
as well.

27
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,780
And I'm going to leave that up to you to add the important concept here is that there are so many ways

28
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,470
to test.

29
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,250
You can always use the covers you report as a reference, but try to be smart about your tests and make

30
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,940
sure that you spend your time wisely because you're just going to have infinite things that you can

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,420
do.

32
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,520
But you only have limited time.

33
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,940
That's it for now, I hope you have a better understanding of how container and components testing can

34
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,510
be enhanced with enzyme and snapshot testing.

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,720
And obviously the tools that come with just the rest of the test is something I'm leaving up to you

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
to complete four components and containers.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,350
But let's get to actions, constants and reducers.

38
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,240
We're going to want to test those as well.

39
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,050
So in the next video, we're going to do just that.

40
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,630
I'll see in that one.

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,810
Bye bye.
