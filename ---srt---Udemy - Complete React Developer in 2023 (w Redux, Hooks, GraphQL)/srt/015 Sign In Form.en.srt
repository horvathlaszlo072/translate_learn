00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,060
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,740
In this video, we are going to start building out our separate sign in form.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,500
But the first thing is first, we might need to shuffle around a couple of things, which is also a

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,980
great habit that you will build as you're building out features.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,230
The key thing that we set up earlier was we set up the sign in page.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,990
But what will notice is that what we're going to host inside of this signing component is going to be

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,440
both the sign up form, but also the sign in form.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,490
So calling this sign in isn't necessarily accurate anymore.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,920
And you'll notice this as you develop your features that sometimes you'll need to rename folders, rename

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,440
files, rethink about how you've architected a lot of these different structures that you've already

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,190
set up in order to make it more accurate to reflect what you need.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,060
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to change this sign in over to authentication, which

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,750
makes more sense, which reflects what it actually is, which is that we're particularly authenticating

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,230
our users now that we've updated this folder structure.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,810
We also need to correctly fix the places where we were importing this sign in before.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,130
So where we had it before was inside of our app as we were importing and sign in from sign and signing

17
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,610
component.

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,220
So let's rename this to what it actually will be, which is our authentication.

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,790
And here I am also going to update our app, J.S. I'm going to update the component to our new authentication

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:45,020
component, and I'm also going to fix the deep linking over to the correct root and also for path.

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,800
I want to change this to off because sign in is no longer accurately reflecting what the path represents.

22
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,330
So we've updated a.

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,420
We also need to update our navigation.

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,760
So inside of our navigation component, we need to switch this from sign into Auth.

25
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,590
So it takes us to the correct place.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,990
So let's make sure that everything's working now.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,030
Let's go back to our application.

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,640
We click our sign and it takes us to off.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,620
It renders the correct component.

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,330
So here everything works.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,880
The next thing we need to do now is we need to start setting up the appropriate component structure.

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,770
So here what we're going to do is we are going to go up to our components.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,950
And what I want to do is I actually know that the sign up form is pretty similar to what we're going

34
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,630
to need for our sign in form.

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,960
So I'm going to copy the whole folder and just paste it in.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,880
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to rename this folder as well as the files.

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm going to call this sign in form.

38
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:53,900
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to rename these different files to sign in form and similarly

39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,060
do the same for the styling.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,600
Next, what I'm going to do is I'm going to update the appropriate places.

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,910
So here I want to make sure that I'm importing in the correct sign in form styles.

42
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,470
And also for the former name, I'm going to rename this to sign in form.

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,600
And now let's save this.

44
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,700
So let's think about the differences between our sign and form and our sign up form.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,130
We know we don't need their display name and we also don't need their confirmed password.

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,380
We just need the email and password.

47
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,770
So similarly, we know that for these form fields, we also will not be this structuring off display

48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,750
name or confirm password anymore.

49
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,220
As for the handle submit, because we're not doing any password confirmation, we don't need that code

50
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,530
and here this whole tribe lock is probably not going to be correct.

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,580
We'll have to figure out something brand new for this code, as well as the error.

52
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,630
So we're essentially just removing everything we know that we won't need.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,140
But the handle change is going to stay the same because similarly, these input fields are going to

54
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,190
need to reflect changes which were need to going to capture inside of our used state.

55
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,690
So everything here can stay.

56
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:21,340
Inside of our actual form, though, we know that we need to change this text so we can say something

57
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,590
like already have an account.

58
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,050
And then we'll just say, sign in with your email and password.

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,630
And inside of the form itself, we don't need this form input for display name.

60
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,460
We need the email.

61
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,970
We need the password, but we no longer need confirm password.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,760
And finally, for the button type, we just need sign in.

63
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:55,870
So here, let's save this, and what we want to do is we just want to bring this into our actual authentication

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:03,640
component just so that we can make sure that everything is working as in everything is plugged in properly.

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,240
So I'm going to update this to sign in form.

66
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,670
And then what we want to do is we want to place the sign and form onto our page.

67
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,100
So here we've just replaced that button that was our log into Google.

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,410
And here now we see inside, we have our sign in page.

69
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,180
So everything is working.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Let's add now the actual functionality to sign in, as well as our Google sign in button.

71
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,920
So we already have our actual method.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,130
I just want to copy this over from our authentication into our sign and form.

73
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,250
So inside of the sign in form, I'm just going to create this method, and what I want to call it is

74
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,110
sign in with Google.

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,000
And here we notice that we need this import, so this import is going to be coming from firebase utils.

76
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,880
So let's copy that over.

77
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,510
And earlier, we had taken this user doc reference to console.log it, but we don't need that anymore

78
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,680
so we can just get rid of it.

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,500
We just need to know that we're creating a user doc off.

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,520
So we're going to copy this sign in with Google Method.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,580
And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create another button and this button is going to

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,080
be our Google sign in.

83
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,180
But remember, we only need one submit button with Google sign, and we don't actually need the submit

84
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,510
button.

85
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,680
We just need it to trigger our sign in with Google Method.

86
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,260
And here, if we save this, we go back.

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,710
We see that we have our Google sign in and when we click it, it does indeed trigger our Google sign

88
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:41,860
it.

89
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,330
So awesome.

90
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,530
Everything here is working so far.

91
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,230
So let's go back.

92
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:56,120
What we also want to do is we want to set this button type over to being a Google button.

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,560
So here we can just pass it, the string Google and we can save this.

94
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,890
And we see that now we have our Google button.

95
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,680
But now we need to style this a little bit.

96
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:16,120
So I'm going to make a new div, an inside of this div is going to be our two button and I'm going to

97
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,030
apply a little bit of styling to this div inside.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,580
And what I also want to do is I want to give it a class name, so I'm going to call this button's container.

99
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:34,610
And inside of our sign and form styles, I'm just going to modify this buttons container so that it

100
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,290
has display flex.

101
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,550
And then I'm also going to justify the content so that it is space between.

102
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,950
And now if I save this.

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,240
There we go.

104
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,890
It looks much closer to what we had before and what we were looking for.

105
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:00,530
Now, as for the actual functionality of submitting this email and password, what I want to do is inside

106
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,290
of our signing component, I want to create this method.

107
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,950
So remember, what we had before was that we need to try something where we are able to take email and

108
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,180
password and sign them in.

109
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:19,010
So what we got to do is go back to our firebase utils and inside of Firebase off if there's a create

110
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,480
user with email and password.

111
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,610
Turns out there's actually a sign in user with email and password.

112
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,970
Sign in user, sign in with email and password.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,420
There it is.

114
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,890
Sign in with email and password.

115
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,810
So similarly, we want to create another interface layer through a helper function, and we'll just

116
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,950
say that this is.

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,970
Sign in off the user with email and password.

118
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,100
So similarly, just like we did with our Create author user, if we don't get an email password, we

119
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,720
don't want to run our function.

120
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,930
But when we do, instead of running, create user with e-mail password, we want to run, sign in with

121
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,710
email and password.

122
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,660
Similarly, as you expect past the hour, you pass the email, you pass the password.

123
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
So let's save this copy this method.

124
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,670
Go back to our sign and form.

125
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:22,020
Pasted inside and now inside of our try, we can just get back our response and then we'll just call

126
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,590
a weight.

127
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,900
On this method, passing in email and password.

128
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,070
And then let's console.log the response.

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,060
So if we say, let's come back.

130
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,530
We open up our console.

131
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,880
And here, let's say, I knew that the email I had was Mike at gmail.com password is one two three four

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,690
one two three four.

133
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,440
If I hit sign in, I see that I get my user object and inside with my user, I get my access token.

134
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
Here, everything works.

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,880
As expected, the user ID, which is this one z MJ Taf inside of our Cloudflare store, is the correct

136
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,120
one.

137
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,680
Z MJ Taf.

138
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,700
There we go.

139
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,080
We have authenticated our user using email and password.

140
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,090
Just like that, so simple.

141
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,840
Much of this is pretty much just a recreation of our sign up component, except with a couple nuances

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,460
and tweaks.

143
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,860
And also we just needed to integrate our Google sign in button.

144
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,870
But everything here is just putting together all those little bits that we already learned.

145
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,730
So in the next video, what we want to do is we want to start this page so that it looks a little bit

146
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,730
more polished and also clean up any last remaining bits and pieces that we have before we're ready to

147
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,040
move on from our authentication.

148
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,500
So with that, I'll see you in the next video.
