00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,520
I wanted to take a second here before we keep going with testing our robo friends up to just go over

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,090
what we've learned from our slides and how it all makes sense now.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,550
We learned that now we have just that we can install that provides for us a test framework, something

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,830
that we can run tests in, and this just also comes with an assertion library where we can use expect

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:38,460
DOT to be equal or to have or all these things that we can do that we saw in our cheat sheet to assert

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,190
something to make sure that this equals this.

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,870
And then we also saw that just comes with a test runner, something that we're able to run the tests

9
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,080
in.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,780
And you saw that in my terminal.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,310
I always have those tests running and checking and making sure that things are always passing.

12
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,910
We also saw that we have mocking functions that we can use.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,700
We saw that in our example where we built our Star Wars API, where we got all those people that we

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,670
could mock the fetch function and make sure that it was called, again, something that comes with just.

15
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,690
Sinon is another popular one that it works very, very similar that you're going to see as well.

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:31,490
And then finally we saw that we can do code coverage by running NPM test, dash, dash, dash, dash

17
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:31,930
coverage.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,200
And it gives us a coverage of where we have tests and where we don't so that we can improve our app.

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,440
I told you this is going to make sense and we're not even done yet.

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:53,030
We saw that we can test our app programmatically, but if we need any time to use some dumb APIs, we

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,020
have those three options.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,510
We can use the actual DOM.

23
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,450
We can use something like puppeteer for a headless browser or something like just dump, which if we're

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,820
using the mount, rendering an enzyme, we can set up as well.

25
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,120
Again, there's this set up is fairly simple and you can check it out on the enzyme documentation.

26
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,730
Oh, yeah, and we also learned that in React, we can use enzyme and snapshot testing to make our tests

27
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,680
super, super easy again.

28
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,390
Another reason that I love using, just especially with Riak projects.

29
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,900
That was a quick break, back decoding, we go in the next video seen on that one by.
