00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,080
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,100
And the last video we discussed about creating a batch so that we can add all of our objects to this

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,980
collection in one successful transaction.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,260
So to do this, we need to use that right batch method that we imported from Firebase Firestorm.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,500
So here, how to use it is we need to instantiate a batch class by saying, Hey, I want to make a batch

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,250
and this batch is going to call right batch.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,320
Right batch is going to return me a batch and we have to pass it, the database that we're trying to

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,190
make this batch on.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,230
So as you've seen with this trend, we just always passed the database to whatever these methods that

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,010
we've imported are.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,700
So now that I have this batch instance, what batch allows me to do is attach a bunch of different,

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,330
let's say, writes, deletes, sets, whatever we can attach all of those to the batch and only when

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,530
we're ready to fire off the batch does the actual transaction begin.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,390
So what we need to do is we need to create a bunch of set methods or not set method, but set events,

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,460
because each of these objects were saying, Hey, I want you to create and set that object into this

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,170
collection as a new document for me.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,850
So to do that, or we're going to do is we're going to say Hey, objects to add for each.

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,470
So for each of these objects, I want you to batch set for me.

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,020
So here we're going to receive this object.

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,490
And if you remember this object is inside of the shop data, it's each of these category objects here

21
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,070
with the title and the items array.

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,920
This is what we're adding in.

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,750
So each of these is the object and we have five, as you can see here, five different objects.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,480
So how we're going to do this is inside of firebase utils again with this object now.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,720
I first want to get the document reference.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,790
So as you get the document reference, I'm going to make one called Dark Ref, and this is equal to

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,710
calling the dark method, which we've done before when we got the user dark method, except in passing

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,440
it DB, I'm going to pass it the collection ref.

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,030
Because the collection rough actually tells directly this dark method, which database we're using because

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,110
we got this collection from calling collection where the DB was already passed.

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,750
So this talk is smart enough to know, Oh, you're giving me a collection.

32
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,140
Most likely you got it because you've already told that collection.

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,280
Ref. what db it's from.

34
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,290
So then with this collection rough, what we also need to get this document is the title or the key.

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,060
What is the value, the key value here?

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,170
So here these are actually the title on the object.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,920
So I'm going to say, Hey, give me object, give me the title, but then lowercase it, because right

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,190
now it's in normal case, meaning the first letter is capitalized.

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,580
Then what we want to do is we want to say, OK, I want you to batch does set.

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,030
On this document reference, because as we know.

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,300
Firebase will give us back a document reference, even if it doesn't exist yet, it will just point

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,650
to that place for this specific key inside of our collection.

43
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,980
And now what we're saying is, hey, set that location and set it with the value of the object itself.

44
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,610
You can pass it some JSON object and it will build out that structure for you.

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,950
And this is our entire batch.

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,610
Then what we need to do is we need to await actually firing off this batch because what happened is

47
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,550
that we iterated over each individual object in the array.

48
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,060
We added an additional batch set called on there, creating a new document reference for each of those

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,410
objects where the key is the title and the value is the object itself.

50
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,030
So now we say batch doc commit and this will begin firing it off.

51
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,770
And then when we're done, we can just quickly console.log done to ourselves.

52
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,770
So we know it's finished.

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,330
So I want to save this.

54
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:59,540
I want to come over to my product's context and then I want to import it in.

55
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,310
So I want to import in ad collection and documents from.

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,040
Are you sales slash Firebase slash firebase utils?

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,700
And then when we want to do is we want to fire this off once.

58
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:24,680
So one important thing here is I'm going to use a use effect and for this use effect, what I'm going

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,900
to say is just use effect should fire only once.

60
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:38,270
And what we fire is this ad collection documents with both the string of categories because that's the

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,460
name that I want for the collection.

62
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,230
And then we're going to pass the shop data as the actual objects we're trying to add.

63
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:52,220
So now what I want to do is I want to save this and inside, just make sure that it ran successfully.

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,850
If it did, we should see done which we do now.

65
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,930
If we go back to our fire store and we refresh what we see, we should see the new categories collection

66
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,140
here.

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,850
Which we do.

68
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,030
And inside we see our different documents that reflect our different categories now.

69
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,380
So there we go.

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,210
What I also want to do, though, is make sure that I delete this use effect because every time you

71
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,160
run it, it's going to try and set new values inside of the database, which we don't want to do.

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,440
We just wanted to do this as a one off thing.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,660
Typically, what happens is you want to do this on your front end, but just for us because we're only

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,870
controlling it on the front end and we have access to all these documents.

75
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,580
I figured it's a good time for you to at least see how you might interact with Firebase when it comes

76
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,230
to storing values in your database.

77
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,240
And we also learn about Batch along the way.

78
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,440
So now that we're done with these, we don't need these values anymore.

79
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm going to keep this important and this use effect because in the next lesson, it's actually important

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,680
for us because what we need to work on now that the data is inside of store is to pull that data down.

81
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,350
But at the very least, we now have data inside a fire store and we now have some method that we can

82
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,890
utilize.

83
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,690
If you don't want it to be title, you can make this more generic because here right now we're saying,

84
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,370
Hey, directly, I'm going to pull this off of objects to add when, in fact, this might not always

85
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,630
be present on these objects.

86
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,040
I know that I said this would be generic, but in this particular case here, we just wanted to use

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
the title to get this through.

88
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,830
In your particular case, you can pass some additional field value which designates which of these values

89
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,430
you want to use.

90
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,660
So here you could do it like so like that and then now you just pass the field in as a third argument.

91
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,380
So in our particular case, this would have been equal to the string of title.

92
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,750
That's another way you can do this to make this work.

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,050
You can also pass this dynamically inside if you want as well.

94
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,250
There's numerous ways you can do this.

95
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,420
But for us, at the very least with what we needed, we just needed to get the title.

96
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,740
But here we have this inside of our fire store.

97
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,320
And now that we have our data on fire store, let's pull it into our application and figure out how

98
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,830
to use it.

99
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,140
So with that, I'll see in the next video.
