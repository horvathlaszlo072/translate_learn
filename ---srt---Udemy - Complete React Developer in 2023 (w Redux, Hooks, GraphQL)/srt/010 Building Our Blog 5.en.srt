00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,290
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,010
So in this lesson, we are just going to add some finishing touches to our blog code.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,120
So in our index, we currently need to sort the actual blog posts themselves so that their order is

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,200
more based on the date.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,390
Having the latest be the ones at the top.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,300
Now, how we can do this is we can actually use a sort method.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,860
The sort method is inside of graphical as well, and as allows us to sort by some specific field value.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,630
And in our case, the one that we want to sort off of is our front matter.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,780
Underscore, underscore, underscore, date.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,490
And the order that we want it to be in is descending order.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,210
Now, if this is confusing, you can actually see this as well inside of.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,220
So if we were to take are all mark down remarks and here we check to sort it.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,970
Inside of here, we see on our sort that we sought by some field and if the field that we want to sort

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,640
by is date, what we have to do is say that it's based off of front matter date you see right here,

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,650
this autocomplete underscore, underscore date.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
That's how we access a property that sits inside of an object on the field.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,800
Now, after this, we want to sort by the order and we can do descending or ascending.

18
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,160
So that's what it is.

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,480
So by this automatically now this is sorted by descending order, we can double check by checking the

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,800
front matter, date value.

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,370
And now we see that the latest ones are at the top.

22
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,740
So that's all we're doing here.

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,330
We're just sorting this by this order.

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,270
Now that we have all of the data, the other thing that we want to do is be able to link to our pages

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,360
from these components.

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,220
So what we can do is we can also pluck off the field and grab the slug from the node itself, because,

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,570
as we know, we've added it in now.

28
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,290
One other thing that we might want to do is actually style this page so that it looks a little better,

29
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,300
the way that I'm going to suggest you do it is with style components, but you can totally do it with

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,630
any other styling that you're comfortable with inside of react.

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,920
So in order to actually add in style components to Gatsby.

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,470
There is a Gatsby plugin that allows us to add style components really easily to our Gatsby folder.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,130
So what we'll do is we will let's just cancel our server first.

34
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,610
And just like before using the package manager that you've been using up until now for you, it's either

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,410
yarn or or NPM.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,590
I'm using yarn.

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,180
Just add in these three packages.

38
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,670
So I'm going to say yarn, add Gatsby, plug in styled components, which is The Gatsby plug in.

39
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,800
First of all, components, we need style components itself.

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,690
So this is the stock components library and then I need the babble plug in styled components.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,430
So we need these three in order to properly run stock components inside of our application and once

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,710
it's finished installing, what we're going to do is modify our Gatsby config.

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,450
So that it includes our Gatsby stock components, plug in and all we do is we just add it somewhere

44
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,850
here.

45
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
I'm just going to put it right here.

46
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:27,520
And it's going to be our Gatsby plug in styled components, and now we're able to load style components

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,610
into our application.

48
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,370
So what I want to do is write style components for my index.

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,630
Now, in order to use the components, we just need to bring it in.

50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:45,070
So we are going to import in styled import in style from style components.

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,730
And then what we're going to write is we are going to make our blog link so we've imported in the slug,

52
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,420
we now actually need to allow our title to be clickable in that way.

53
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,680
Now, the first component I'm going to make is a blog link.

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,660
So this is pretty much just us using the style component library, wrapping around the link component

55
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,890
that we get from Gatsby.

56
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,070
And what I'm going to say is I want to apply the styling of having no text decoration.

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,450
The reason for this is because the link is actually just in a tag with some modifications on it.

58
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,530
So in our case, I don't want any of the styling that comes with an attack.

59
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:33,630
After that, I'm going to use it to actually just wrap around the actual span tag that we have here.

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,360
So I'm just going to put in my blog link.

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,380
And this is just going to navigate us to our noad.

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,590
Fields, that slug.

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,960
So now our blog link actually points us to our blog feel that we have.

64
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,910
After that, I'm going to make another one called blog title.

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,880
And this blog title is just going to be a styled H3.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,380
And on this component, I am going to put a, uh, let's just say a margin bottom of 20.

67
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,690
Let's actually make it blue as well, just so that we can see the changes and then I'm going to replace

68
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,650
this span with it.

69
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,430
Now, if I save and we go back to our application.

70
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,600
We'll see that our links are now clickable and they take us to our respective blog post.

71
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,830
That's pretty much all that we need to do in order to actually build out our blog.

72
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,990
Now, the last thing that you might want to do is host this somehow.

73
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,620
Gatsby's actually really great with another service called Net Lafi that VI allows us to host static

74
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,670
websites and get continuous development pretty much for free.

75
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,800
And the easiest way to do that is you just first instantiate a GitHub repo that you put your code into.

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,230
So we're going to make a new repo and I'm just going to call it New Gatsby blog.

77
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,220
I am going to just copy this key, so if you don't have access that up, just use https.

78
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,110
It's about the same.

79
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,170
And then I'm just going to make sure to run get Adarsh a get commit.

80
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,830
Adding all.

81
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,110
Our new blog code for Gatsby set up.

82
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:37,020
And then I'm going to get add remote origin and then paste in that key that we just covid.

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,590
Website, get remote, add origin and then paste that key.

84
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,510
So now that we have a remote origin, I'm going to run, get push origin master with the new code that

85
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:48,960
we have.

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,390
And now that we have the set up, what we're going to do is we simply go to net Lafi now on net Lafi

87
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,200
you have to sign up.

88
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
If you haven't signed up, just make sure to do so.

89
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,010
Once you've signed up, just make a log in and now it's so incredibly easy to actually set this up.

90
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,570
So what you need to do is just make sure that your code is actually on the new site that you've got

91
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,330
in your repo.

92
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,160
So we see that my code is now inside of my New Gatsby blog repo.

93
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,220
And what I'm going to do is just click this news site from Gett.

94
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,610
I'm going to select GitHub for the continuous deployment option.

95
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,950
And it's going to ask to authorize me now, you probably have to allow it to authorize you to connect

96
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,110
to your GitHub and what you're going to do is just find the name of your actual repo.

97
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,310
Once you have it, you click it by default.

98
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,890
All of these settings should be good.

99
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,200
It's going to run The Gatsby build and once you click deploy, that's it.

100
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,540
It's in the process of building and deploying your website.

101
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,510
And once your website's finished, it's going to give you the actual link that tells you what your site

102
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,200
is hosted to.

103
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,750
So let's just wait for our website to finish deploying.

104
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,210
OK, so now that it's finished, we see that we get are you, Earl, we simply click it.

105
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,300
And now we are live with our blog.

106
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,940
So if you actually want to make any changes, it's super easy because all you do is you just write the

107
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,730
code, you push to get hub and automatically net Lafi will restart and reboot and redeploy your website.

108
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,460
So here I actually did add in any posts.

109
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,470
So what I'm going to do right here is I'm just going to add the word posts.

110
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,740
I'm going to save I'm going to get add.

111
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,950
Added word posts I'm going to push.

112
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:49,900
And once this pushes up to my GitHub again, if you go back to nullify, you might actually see when

113
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,550
you scroll down here and production deploys that there's this new second tab for another production.

114
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,270
So this is actually a list of all of the deployments that are being made now, yours might say include

115
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,660
or it might see in progress.

116
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,100
Mine just got published.

117
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,640
So now if I go back to my blog and I refresh, I see the word up there.

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,510
So this is awesome because I just immediately gives you tenuous development right off the gate with

119
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,380
your GitHub account.

120
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,940
And it was so simple to set up.

121
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,790
So with this, you pretty much have your blog.

122
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
All the code is written.

123
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,270
You can pretty much use stock components or any other styling system you want and tackle the coding

124
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,590
challenge as you please.

125
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,300
So good luck, everybody.

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,150
And I hope you enjoyed this lesson on how to use Gatsby.
