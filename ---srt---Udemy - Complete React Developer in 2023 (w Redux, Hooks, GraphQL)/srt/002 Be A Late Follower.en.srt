Hey there, it's time for another lesson, and the lesson in this video is to be a late follower.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,970
What do I mean?

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,760
React is a tool that's constantly evolving.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,860
No program, no software, no library is ever perfect.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,640
So the community is constantly improving.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,170
It right now.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,330
Reacts version is sixteen point eight.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,810
But by the time you watch this video, most likely it's going to be higher and higher because it's constantly

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,310
improving.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,160
You have things like react hooks that were recently added.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,840
We're going to have suspense, concurrency mode and react.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:48,130
There's things like react, fire, react, fiber, a lot of planned updates that are coming.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,180
And sometimes it can be overwhelming to keep up with everything.

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,160
And this is my advice to you.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,220
Usually what happens when something gets announced is that people get really, really excited and they

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,620
start want to using it right away in their project.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,080
The problem is that sometimes.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,930
Developers don't get it right the first time, it takes some time to develop best practices, sometimes

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,300
maybe the API isn't good enough.

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,560
So they decide to change some things because of this.

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,240
When you're looking at react for your project, you want to make sure that you do things that aren't

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,120
going to change.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
Ideally, your project can last a long time.

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,700
If you're adding the latest features, what's going to happen is most likely a year down the road,

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,600
somebody realizes that there's a better way of doing it.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,690
So take your time if something's new.

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,740
Learn about it.

28
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,820
Get excited about it.

29
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,880
But be cautious that just assuming that it's the best way to do something is not always the case.

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,820
Usually you want to give it a bit of time.

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,310
Somewhere around a year until the community settles on best practices.

32
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,470
If you were at the beginning when I got started, I remember people were doing things that, well,

33
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,670
just doesn't exist anymore.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,380
People were building components in ways that actually doesn't exist anymore.

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,290
So all those people had to update their code base because of these changes that were coming.

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:31,100
I remember working at a company in Silicon Valley and we implemented the latest version of REACT Router

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,390
and unfortunately it was not well documented because it was so new.

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,720
So we had to spend a really, really long time waiting for the API to settle before we had a working

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,010
product because we chose to do something that, well, was at the very cutting edge.

40
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,590
So be a late follower.

41
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,120
You don't want to be the first one to try out something.

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,820
Sometimes it's good to be behind the early adopters.
