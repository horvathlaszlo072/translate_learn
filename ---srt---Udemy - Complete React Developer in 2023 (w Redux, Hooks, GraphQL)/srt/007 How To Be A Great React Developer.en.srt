1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,950
We learned the four main concepts that really made react take off.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,180
It gave developers a whole new way to think about their applications and how we built them, and it

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:21,010
was architected in such a way that it made building large scale applications a lot more pleasant than

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,900
what we had before.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,240
Now, since then, a lot of libraries have come out that have taken some of the concepts.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,990
Angular was rewritten to a new version that is more in line with these concepts.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:43,480
Libraries like View are also using these concepts because people have realized that these are some really

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,260
good principles.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,120
So now you have things like react angular view that developers are using to build front end applications.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,350
But react really had this initial jump and it's still the most popular library and the library with

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,660
the most job demand because it was the first to introduce these principles and the beauty.

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,550
Is that although we haven't written any code, you've now learned a little bit about some of the key

13
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,690
words that will encounter throughout this course, and don't worry, you're not supposed to get them

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,360
100 percent just now because all of these things are something that we need to practice code and build

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,270
projects with to really understand them.

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,240
But now when you hear the words like declarative components, state props, virtual dom, you'll have

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,720
an idea of what it is, because we've learned that react is a declarative paradigm.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:46,000
That is, instead of telling our APS exactly what to do, we simply give it some state, some components

19
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,500
that are built with something called.

20
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:55,790
And these components sometimes receive properties which are called props, we give all that information,

21
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:04,520
a giant JavaScript object in a declarative way, which creates a virtual dom in JavaScript, and that

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:13,480
virtual dom is used by the React Library to update the DOM for us in a declarative way.

23
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,140
But your question is this how do I become the best reactive helper I can be?

24
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,920
And to be a great reactive helper, it actually comes down to three things, three things that really,

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,680
really good senior reactive helpers do well, and we're going to focus on these three skills throughout

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,130
the course.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,870
The first one is to decide on components really good reactive Alpers, decide what is a component,

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,030
how much do we want to break down a component?

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,840
How do we build these reusable components as we've seen?

30
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,190
And deciding on how to break down the app into different components is a very important skill.

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,710
The next thing is to decide the state and where it lives.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,960
Now we're going to explore this idea of state or data or app a lot more.

33
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,060
But this state can live in different locations in our virtual dorm.

34
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,750
So whether we put the state here or we put the state here or here or here or in multiple locations,

35
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,250
that decision is very important in architecting your app.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,610
And really good developers do a really good job placing state in the appropriate component.

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:37,050
The third is what changes should we make when the state changes based on what this JavaScript object

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:45,150
called state is changed, we have to decide what to render, what part of the virtual dom changes.

39
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,270
And deciding on this is also important because it has huge effects on performance.

40
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,640
Now, don't worry, these are the things that we're going to really work on, but I want you to keep

41
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,360
this as a reference, because if you want to become a senior developer, these are the things that you

42
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,030
have to become really good at making these decisions and knowing when something is good, when when

43
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,990
something is bad.

44
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,190
We're going to explore that and a lot more.

45
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,710
The next section I'll see in the next one by.
