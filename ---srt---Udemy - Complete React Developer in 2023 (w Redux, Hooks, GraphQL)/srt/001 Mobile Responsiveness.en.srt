1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,410
Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:10,600
So in the last few sections, I know we didn't work off of our main application because we were mostly

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:18,760
implementing in different features that can challenge the existing solutions of react redux inside of

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,630
our main e-commerce platform by testing out context API and then switching over to graphical and Apollo

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,220
client.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:33,130
So it's actually been a while since we've worked on our main application, but now that we've finished

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:39,820
those tangential sections where we've really deeply explored other alternatives to the React Redux architecture

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:47,710
that we already currently have, it's time we come back and start rounding out our application with

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,120
the last 20 percent that gives our application that extra month.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,020
Now, these things might not actually be any features at all.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,580
In fact, in the upcoming sections, we are going to round out your skillset as a web developer so that

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,540
you understand that last kind of mysterious part of what it takes to build an application effectively

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,090
and have it be performance.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,970
So one of the first things that I want to talk about is actually making our website mobile friendly.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,980
Now, currently, our website is not mobile friendly.

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,070
It is a little bit responsive, but it's not fully optimized for the mobile viewing experience.

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:39,250
So what we are going to do is actually modify the case in our files to show that they are more aligned

18
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,160
with how we would want it to look on a mobile browser.

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,820
And I'm going to show you that by using media queries now before we actually dive into the code of writing

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,730
or media queries.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,300
One of the main things we have to think about is actually how do we make sure that we can view our application

22
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,060
inside of a mobile environment?

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,450
If you're rolling chrome, it's actually extremely easy to do so.

24
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:09,280
The Chrome browser allows us to just open up the dev tools and click this little tablet looking icon

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,390
inside at the top of that toolbar, which says Toggle device toolbar.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:22,300
If you click this, you'll actually see your mobile web view be your main view now where your browser

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,990
was before.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,660
You can adjust the size of this and in the top number here, you'll see the actual width and height

29
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,830
of your new view.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
So this pretty much simulates a mobile view.

31
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,150
So this is the main way that we are going to use it to see what it is that we are actually going to

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,930
have as the mobile version of our Web application.

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,560
Now that we have this, we are going to start leveraging these media queries to modify our code to be

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
more mobile friendly.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,800
So let's go back to our application.

36
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:05,860
One of the first things that we need to do is actually change this final access file over to start components.

37
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,510
Now, the way that we imported the stylesheet is perfectly fine, right?

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,800
It's just one aftertax stylesheet that doesn't necessarily have to change when we moved over to Season

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,340
Jass.

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,270
But for consistency sake, we might as well do it.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,130
And it's really easy in order to implement global styles.

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,170
All we have to do is use this new function called Creates Global Stars, so in order for us to do that,

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,620
we're going to make a new folder that will hold the component that represents our global status.

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,670
So we'll write this new file and we'll call it global dot styles DOT.

45
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:50,890
Now, inside of here, we are going to import in from the Style Components Library, this thing called

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,340
create global style.

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:02,290
So with this, we can actually create this new concept called global style, which is equal to us using

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,290
this crazy global stuff.

49
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,440
And then we pass it, are to build a version of our strength.

50
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,380
Right, because we want strong interpolation.

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,950
And now all we do is we just put all the styles that we had inside of our index access inside of here.

52
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,980
If we really wanted to, we could even do it with our index as well, but this is inside of our index

53
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,450
and it's not 100 percent necessary.

54
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:27,840
Right.

55
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,690
Let's just do it with our access.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,140
So once we place the new stars inside of this global star, we'll make sure to export this out.

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,880
And all we need to do in order to bring it into our application is literally load it at the top level

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,600
of our app.

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,190
So what we'll do is we will go back to our objects, will remove this import that we had before and

60
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,510
in its place we will import in our global sales.

61
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:06,960
So let's actually move this header up here and say import global style from our new global styles file.

62
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,930
And now it's literally just the component that we can put above the header like so and this will apply

63
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,320
those styles into our application.

64
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,420
So if we go back to our application and we search you back, we'll see that our global style and our

65
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,530
padding is still there.

66
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,280
In fact, if we inspect this, we see we still have our padding and our body still has the padding code

67
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,540
that we had from our global.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,740
So it's really convenient to do it this way because now we are pretty consistent with the way that we're

69
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,450
writing our code.

70
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,170
In fact, now we can get rid of this after successful because we don't need it anymore and we can start

71
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,820
leveraging these media queries.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,300
So the first thing I want to do is I want to reduce the padding on this mobile view of our application.

73
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,820
So how do I do that?

74
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,980
Well, I keep talking about media queries, so I'm going to show you what it actually looks like when

75
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,540
we write them.

76
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,660
You put the media query inside of the CSA selector that you want to modify.

77
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,450
So if we have style components, we just make sure to put this media query inside of that style component

78
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,860
as well.

79
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,380
And the way that a media career looks is it takes the format of this at media.

80
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:32,080
And here what we'll say is scream and and then inside of here, we put certain properties that tell

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,130
it, at what point do we want this style block to be applied?

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,550
Now, here you can set things like Menwith and Max with or just one or the other, and all this is saying

83
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,420
is pretty much I only want you to render the block here that will put inside of here.

84
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,080
So wherever here it is, we'll say there's some scissors inside of here.

85
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,430
Right.

86
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,630
We only want this to render based on the rules that we write inside of these brackets.

87
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,920
So in my case, I'm going to say max width is eight hundred pixel.

88
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:16,840
Meaning that anything below eight hundred and below in terms of the width will get these styles, anything

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,760
above eight hundred pixels will not get these styles.

90
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,820
So our body styles will be applied.

91
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,310
But then these media screen max width of eight hundred pixels, this block of access that we're about

92
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,910
to write is going to be applied as long as the windows width does not exceed eight hundred pixels.

93
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,330
So here, I want to set the panning to 10 pixels all around instead of what we had before where our

94
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,390
padding was 20 pixels, top bottom 40 pixels on the left.

95
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,490
And right now, if we save when we go back, we see that our padding has shrunk.

96
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Now we only have a 10 pixel board or padding around the body.

97
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,550
So that is our immediate query now, Ilinka, resource for you guys to see other media queries that

98
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,500
you can write because there's so many, right?

99
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,000
This is literally just the pixel.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Not that I chose to dictate because I find with iPhones there, pixel count based on the new retina's

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
is a little bit challenging so that sometimes the amount of pixels that you think it might be might

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,870
be a little higher.

103
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,490
I find that most browsers do not have a with smaller than just pixels.

104
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:32,780
And if it's a tablet, it's perfectly fine if it responds the same way as we would see for a mobile

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,780
device if it was inside of a portrait view.

106
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,770
So I find a hundred pixels to be one that I'm comfortable with.

107
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,790
Of course, you can dictate and set them to whatever else you want, resources that I've linked for

108
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,210
you have multiple break points that are also always changing as the technology for phones gets better,

109
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,090
screen resolutions get larger.

110
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,620
It's literally just completely dictated by whatever you and your team decide to do.

111
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,220
I personally like this 800 pixel rule for my max with for a project like this where mobile views are

112
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,350
not big is the most important thing to me.

113
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,140
But I do want my screen to be responsive and I want my application to be responsive.

114
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,500
And it's really just that simple.

115
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,930
We have this media query for our mobile view of eight hundred pixels right or below, and then we just

116
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,570
make sure to modify the padding or whatever other properties we want to set differently or also add

117
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:29,900
now.

118
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,210
Right.

119
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,250
So that our screen responds the right way when it's in this mobile view.

120
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,110
Now, I'm going to go around and modify a couple more components in the next lesson, but then I do

121
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,060
want you guys to try it yourself and tinker around with it, because this is a great chance for you

122
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,780
to kind of see and play around with some of the success so you can have it look a way that you want.

123
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,360
In the end.

124
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,180
It's really just a matter of taste with styling.

125
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,500
But I'm going to show you what I'll do for some of these components that I think we'll end up looking

126
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,800
nice.

127
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,490
So you can either proceed yourself with trying to convert some of these styles yourself first.

128
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,330
You can watch the next video and then do it after that.

129
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,710
It's entirely up to you.

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,390
But this section is purely on making our website responsive.

131
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,430
So with that, I will see you in the next lesson.
