00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:08,420
So let's finish setting up our action creators here inside of an item to cart.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,360
What I want to do is I want to make sure that I pass in the current state of what these cart items will

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,570
be.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,710
Similarly, I want to do the same for remove items, a cart as well as clear item from cart.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,590
These are all necessary because I need to actually generate the new cart items through which I will

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,300
instead of calling update.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,590
Now what we'll do is we will dispatch the action itself.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,990
But the dispatch is going to be from the action, and the action is what we need to generate.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,110
So to generate the action, we need our create action because that's what we're going to return back

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,830
from this function.

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,650
And our create action is going to receive the new cart items as the payload.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,430
But we're also going to receive cart action types, set cart items as the actual action type.

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,970
So here, because each of these are called new car actions, we can just move it over like so.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,850
Then lastly, we just need to make sure that we export out each of these action creators.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,390
And this will be the action creator that we use in order to replicate our previous behavior inside of

17
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,050
context.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,180
So now that we have our action creators, we can, of course, further tweak them once we have everything

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,600
set up.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,240
Now it's time to think about the selectors.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,940
So with our selectors, as we know now, what we want to do is we want to work off of the car items

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,260
inside of the reducer in order to generate the car total as well as the car count.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:52,140
So here what I'm going to do is I am going to create the basic input selectors that I know we always

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,380
need.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,290
The first one, of course, is to extract off just this slice of state.

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:08,970
So here I'm going to say select cart reducer is equal to us receiving state and then us getting state

27
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,600
scorecard.

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,510
So this will give us just this cart slice that is governed by this slice of the reducer.

29
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,550
So nothing here, much different.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,490
The next thing that I want to do, which is going to be probably something we want to memorize, is

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,480
getting the actual cart items off of this slice of our state.

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,920
So here I'm going to say export const select cart.

33
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,740
Items.

34
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,710
Is equal to create selector where we receive select cart reducer.

35
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,850
And then off of this, we get the cart.

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,330
We want to return carts, dock cart items.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,760
We probably want something similar for our is open.

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,940
So I'm going to say select is carte open.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,450
Which is equal to create selector receiving select cart reducer.

40
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,420
Once we get the cart along, carport is cart open.

41
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:23,600
Now, as far as new counts and the cart total goes, we want these as the logic in our new selector

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,050
logic.

43
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,010
So here I'm going to make contact select.

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,290
Can't count.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:40,690
And this is again a create selector that receives select cart items because off of these cart items

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,510
is where we're going to actually get the total value of all of these items.

47
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,720
So I'm going to take this reduce I'm going to put it here.

48
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,980
Similarly, I need a new.

49
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,950
Select cart total.

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:05,960
Which is create selector passing in select car items again as the basis and then from the car items.

51
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,530
Now will reduce over these card items for the total.

52
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,630
So I'm just going to copy this over.

53
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,090
And get rid of the semicolon.

54
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,510
But that's it.

55
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,680
We know that we need to extrapolate out the logic that we had before we just moved it into our new normal

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,270
selectors that we get from Pre-select.

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,320
And the key thing here is that no longer are we storing cart total and cart quantity inside of our reducer.

58
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,490
Instead, now everything is based off of card items which we know it will be.

59
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,730
And through using memoir selectors, unless those cards change, we won't be running any extra renders.

60
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,620
So now comes the long and arduous process of making sure everything works as we expect it to by replacing

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,770
everything that calls our old car context.

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,600
So to begin, what we know we need to do is we need to gut out the car provider from our index chase

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,470
because we are no longer utilizing the car provider.

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,570
The next thing that we need to do is figure out where car context is being called inside of the application

65
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:24,390
and slowly migrate over using these new methods that we've created the creators, the actual selectors.

66
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,560
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave this to you, try it out.

67
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,500
And in the next video I'm going to show you how we do this.

68
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,790
But I want you to get some practice first to really figure out where you need to import, what you need

69
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,880
to remove, what you need to call from what hooks.

70
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,310
It's always good practice and we have quite a few of them to do inside of our application.

71
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,630
So try it out.

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,060
And then in next video you'll see how I do it.

73
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,710
I'll see you in the next video.
