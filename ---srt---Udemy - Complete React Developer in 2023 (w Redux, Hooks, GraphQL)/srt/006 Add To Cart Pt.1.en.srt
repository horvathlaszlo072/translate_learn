00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,510
In this video, we are going to talk about adding our products into our cart.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,730
So let's take a look at the final format and think about the current data that we have.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,070
So inside, we know that we need to show the image, the name, the price.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,050
And then this quantity.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:30,290
So really, a core item looks kind of like a encapsulation of our product data, except there is an

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,300
additional quantity parameter.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,820
So how do we transform our data from this over into this accurately as we add more items into the cart?

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,710
Well, that's actually going to be the meat of the logic, we need to figure out that whenever we add

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:54,040
some item into our cart, we have to check if it already exists as in cart item and if it does, then

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,360
we increase the quantity.

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,600
But if it doesn't, then we create a new cart item.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,360
So that's going to be the logic that we need to tackle.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,690
And really, we should do that before we start styling out the cart item.

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,490
So let's figure that out.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,550
First, what I want to do is I want to make a new folder for the cart item, so at least we have something

17
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,180
to work with.

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,110
So here inside, I want to make the cart item, dot styles, dot sass, and maybe we don't fill it out,

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,400
but we just make the file.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,030
And I also want to mark a cart item component dot GSX.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,120
So inside, let's think about what we need for this cart item.

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,310
We most likely will.

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,480
Let's just first generate the base of the actual file we want to import in our style sheet.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,770
We want to create the actual cart item component.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,030
And then we want to export as default the cart item.

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,120
So now that we're inside the card item, let's just return for now, a device that will hold out the

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,470
actual total.

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,660
Of the HTML.

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:08,680
And then let's put an H2, which will have just the name so that we at least know what item we're looking

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:08,860
at.

31
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,110
And this name is going to come from, let's just say the item that we pass in here.

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,710
And then we structure off the name so far.

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:29,600
So all I'm saying is that I know that what I'm going to pass in is going to be some kind of version

34
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,610
of the product that we already store those product JSON objects.

35
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,420
But here we need also somewhere to keep track of quantity.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,330
So this is where I'm just going to say that I'm going to assume that what gets passed in will also include

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,010
the quantity and I'm going to make a span that will show the quantity.

38
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,150
Like so.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,390
So here all I need to do now is actually put this into the car itself.

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,520
The car drop down, which is where this olive.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,170
So first, let's import in.

42
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,160
Our Carte item.

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,800
And then what we're going to do is we are going to say, OK, how are we going to get these items into

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
our cart dropdown?

45
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,030
Well, let's think about this a little bit first.

46
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,410
What is it exactly that we need to add?

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,640
We need to map over some kind of array, we know that.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,390
And for every item that we map through, we want to pass this to the cart item like so.

49
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,930
So here, this array that we're mapping through is going to be kind of similar.

50
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,030
But the only thing is that the way that we get this array, it's not completely like the products,

51
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,340
it's going to be some variation of the products, as we mentioned, but with the quantity on it.

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,710
So to do that, let's think about leveraging our cart context.

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,810
Our car context already stores things related to our cart.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,990
So what we could store is the actual cart items that are inside of our cart, as they're added.

55
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,860
So let's think about what the data shape of cart items should be.

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:25,900
We know that right now we already have products, so our products essentially are objects that have

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,690
the shape where there's an ID, there's a name, there's a price and there's an image URL.

58
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,300
All of these are same characteristics that we want on a cart item.

59
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,440
The only difference is that we also want a quantity.

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,690
So what we're going to store inside of this car items array is pretty much something that looks like

61
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,960
the product, except we also have an additional quantity.

62
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,930
So let's actually start fleshing this out.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,900
What we want to do is we want to also figure out whenever you add something to this cart items, what

64
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,710
are we going to do to it?

65
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,550
Well, we know that in order for us to control the quantity, we probably don't want them to set directly.

66
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,990
This cart items array the way that we've been doing so with a separate set or function.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,770
And then maybe you want to define our own method that we happen to expose something like an ad item

68
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:26,310
to cart where we explicitly control what it is that this item to cart function is going to do.

69
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,520
So first, let me initialize the cart items and then the set cart items.

70
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,470
You state look.

71
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,090
And by default, we're going to use an empty array.

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,900
What I'm also going to do is I'm going to now trying to find this ad item to cart method.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:57,050
This ad item is a cart method is going to be a function that triggers whenever a user clicks on this

74
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,770
add to cart.

75
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,270
So that means that what we're going to receive from the product cart is going to be the product to add.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
So that's the key thing to remember.

77
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,310
We're going to receive a product based off this product.

78
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:18,470
We need to decide, OK, do I need to make a new car item if this cart is empty of any of this product

79
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,340
that they're trying to add?

80
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,120
Or do I find the existing car item for this product and then just increase the quantity by one?

81
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,960
That's the logic that we need to add into this.

82
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:39,710
So what we can say is that we know that what we're going to set this cart items value to is the newest

83
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,000
up to date array.

84
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,560
So here I'm going to create some kind of helper function that's going to help me find inside of my existing

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,860
array.

86
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,870
Any carte items that exist that match the idea of this product.

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,380
And then if I can find it, I'm going to increment the quantity.

88
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,410
Otherwise, I'm going to make a new cart item.

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,820
So here, let me write out at least some pseudocode.

90
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,740
So I want to say, Konst, add cart item like this.

91
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,220
What we're going to receive is the cart items array.

92
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,520
Because this is what we're going to look through to try and find a matching product.

93
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,620
And of course, I'm also going to pass through the product ad because that's essentially what they're

94
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,520
trying to ad through.

95
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,090
So here I need to do two things.

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,140
The first is find if carte items contains product to add.

97
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,170
That's the first step.

98
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,610
Then what we do.

99
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,650
Is, if found, increment quantity.

100
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:56,280
And then finally, return new array with modified cart items, slash new cart item.

101
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,210
So that's kind of what we need to figure out for this function, because what we're going to do is that

102
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,920
this ad car item is going to be what we set our new cart to.

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:14,510
So we're going to call set car items calling out of cart item passing through what we have for cart

104
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,780
items here, as well as this product to add.

105
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,580
So my challenge to you is actually to try and see if you can figure out how to code this.

106
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:32,050
Remember, what we should get back is a new array of car items, except this product to add, has either

107
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,600
been added as a new card item or as an existing card item with an increased quantity.

108
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,800
So I know it's kind of challenging, but really think about it and really try and figure out if you

109
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,340
can do this.

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,410
And then the next video we'll do it together.
