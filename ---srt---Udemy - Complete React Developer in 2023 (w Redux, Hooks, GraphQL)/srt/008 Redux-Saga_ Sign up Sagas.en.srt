1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,220
In this video, we are going to write our sign up sagas.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,490
Now, the sign up sagas are a little bit more interesting.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,350
The reason why is because we're probably going to have to make it in multiple steps.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,880
If you remember with how our sign up form component works is that when the user submits the form, we

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,590
check if their password matches.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,530
If it does, then what we do is we create an off user with the email and password.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
So this creates a user off for us.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Very similar to Google Sign in.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,000
Once we get that user off object, then we manually trigger create user document from off.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,960
The reason being that when you sign up you are not signed in.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,600
So signing up and signing in with that signed up user are two different steps.

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,140
We did merge the actual sign and step with generating the actual user document from the user off.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,440
So that is an additional thing that we will need to do.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,190
So when breaking up the saga, these are probably going to be two sagas, one to create the user and

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,850
one to sign in the user with the signed up user.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,110
So the first thing we need to do is inside of our action types, create the three new action types for

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,680
sign up.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,920
So we'll say Sign up, start.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,960
User slash.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,050
And then we need to sign up.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
Success.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,850
User slash.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,800
And then we need to sign up.

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,850
Failed.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,190
And then we'll create the corresponding actions.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:53,960
So the first thing we need is that when we sign up start, we are going to receive the email, the password

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,220
and the display name because those are the only fields that we ask them to fill in.

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,050
From here, we are going to create a new action using our new sign up start.

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,660
And then we'll pass an object as the payload where we have the email, the password and the display

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:14,840
name.

32
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,890
We also need this sign up success.

33
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,620
So a sign of success.

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,170
Let's think about what it is that we're going to get back.

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,380
We're going to get back that user off object.

36
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,000
And then we need any additional details that we're going to store for that user.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,840
For us, that's most likely going to be the display name that gets passed through.

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,000
And if we in the future choose to add more fields will have to also add those in here.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,140
But those are all going to fall under this category of additional details.

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,570
So here I'm going to say sign up.

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:58,030
Success is going to be us receiving an object where we have the user and the additional details.

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,430
We're going to say create action calling user action types, sign up success.

43
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,210
And then we're just going to pass through the user and the additional details.

44
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,520
So here, because this is the same, we can technically actually tweak this a bit.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,900
Maybe we can make it so that when we call a sign up success, we get them as separate fields, which

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,330
we then aggregate inside of this object.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,900
This might be much more clear rather than actually passing an object.

48
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,900
And then finally we need our sign up failed, which is just going to give us an error and we'll call

49
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,400
create action on user action types dot sign.

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,820
Up failed.

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,960
And here we'll pass the error as the payload.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,240
So let's start actually writing the sagas with these three new actions.

53
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,530
So first we want to do is we need the entry point saga.

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,990
So I'm going to say export function on sign up start.

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
This is going to yield.

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Take latest.

57
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:20,220
On user action types dot sign up start and here I'm going to call sign up, which is the name of this

58
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,750
generator that I've yet to write.

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,630
So here, let's create it.

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,290
Let's say export function star sign up.

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,590
We received the action off the action.

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,350
We just want the payload and off the payload.

63
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,270
We're going to get the email, the password, as well as the display name.

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,600
And now what we're going to do is we are going to attempt to create this user auth object.

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,270
So of course, we have our tri catch block.

66
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,080
And then we need to actually bring in the method that we had created in our Firebase Utils or create

67
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,850
off user with email and password.

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,520
So importing it in, we're going to say yield call, create off user with email and password.

69
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,940
And here we're just going to pass email and password.

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,370
We don't do anything yet with a display name.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,940
When this call succeeds, what we get back again is an off object that we've already seen before.

72
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,170
So this is on the user key, as we've done so far up to this point.

73
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:29,660
And once that succeeds, what we'll do is we'll say, Hey, we have succeeded in signing up, so we'll

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,600
create that sign up success method.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,920
Now this is that action that we had just created right here.

76
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,490
And what we're doing is we're dispatching sign up success.

77
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,570
Sign up.

78
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,030
Success doesn't actually do anything to our reducers.

79
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,810
It's not for the reducers, it's for our user saga.

80
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,350
So we need to create yet even another entry saga for on.

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,940
Sign up.

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,140
Success.

83
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:09,730
And here we're going to yield take latest our user action types dot sign up success.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,370
So we're listening for sign of success.

85
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,790
And once that happens, we are going to trigger a sign in after sign up.

86
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,750
Generator.

87
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,660
So this is where, as I mentioned, we need to break up the two steps.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
So we'll need another generator.

89
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,050
And this generator is going to receive the action that we had made for sign of success.

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,510
So it's going to get a payload of user and additional details on the action.

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,380
So we're going to want to structure off payload, the user and the additional details.

92
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,860
And then we're going to yield all of these values to our get snapshot from user off.

93
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,460
And there we go.

94
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,220
That is our sign in after sign up.

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,810
Generator.

96
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,060
So what we need to do now is just make sure that we're actually passing the appropriate values to our

97
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,260
sign up success.

98
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,640
So the sign of a success is going to get user and additional details as to values.

99
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,560
So let's set that up where we pass them in as user and then the additional details as an object with

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,550
just display name.

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,180
And then that's pretty much all we need for the tri section.

102
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,630
As far as the catch section, we need to yield out the put.

103
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,770
As we always do, where we have signed up failed.

104
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,510
We pass the error.

105
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,900
And now that we have these, we need to make sure that we're also listening for them inside of our saga.

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,910
So we'll call both on sign up, start and sign up success.

107
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,480
And then once we're all listening, we need to make sure our sign up form now is actually dispatching.

108
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,680
Sign up, start.

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,770
So here what we'll do is we will bring in our hook so that we have access to dispatch.

110
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,750
And we also need to bring in the appropriate sign up start action creator.

111
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,220
And then we need to get the dispatch from the U.S Dispatch Hook.

112
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,410
And then with dispatch, we now replace this method right here with our dispatch.

113
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:43,580
Our sign up start and then we pass it the email, the password and the display name.

114
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,770
So we save this.

115
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,570
We have everything set up.

116
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,060
So now let's sign in.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,510
Let's use my good friend Mo, who builds the React Native course.

118
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,940
I'm going to say Mo at Gmail.

119
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,370
And now if I sign up.

120
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,510
We see that we have a sign up success and we see that we have our sign in success inside of here.

121
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:12,020
If we look inside of our user and our current user, you may notice that there are something odd here

122
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,560
in the fact that we only have our I.D. but not the other values.

123
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,960
This is actually something that's a little bit annoying about Firebase with this create user through

124
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,770
email and password.

125
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,230
Sometimes this is a little slower and what it's doing is is rectifying and actually trying to rewrite

126
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,560
this.

127
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,050
This might actually be an error with V9.

128
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm not fully sure, but if you refresh because we know we've successfully signed in, if you now check

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,510
inside of your current user, you actually see all of those other fields that we have.

130
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,900
So this is one tiny little tweak that actually happens that we got to watch out for.

131
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,380
But at the very least, we know that on our side, as far as our code is correct, that's all that really

132
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,770
matters.

133
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,060
But here we go.

134
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,090
We have our sign up and then we have our sign in.

135
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,370
So this is a really monstrous and challenging part of the course.

136
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,300
Absolutely.

137
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,620
A lot of new concepts, a lot of coordination along new patterns of generators.

138
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,430
We haven't learned before.

139
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,270
But before we move on, there's still one more, which is sign out.

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,180
So I do want you to try and figure it out yourself first.

141
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,260
If not, join me in the next video.

142
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,340
We'll code out.

143
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,090
Sign out together.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,650
I'll see you in the next video.
