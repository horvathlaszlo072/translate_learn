00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,520
Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,930
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how you can set up your environment so that you can follow this

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:14,140
course with all of the tools that I have and that you'll see throughout the course along the way, I'll

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,850
mention some alternatives that you might use.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,570
It's entirely up to you because these are all just tools.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,330
And I simply have my own set up that I use throughout this course.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,300
Now, the first thing you need to install is your editor.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,420
So if you already have an editor that you prefer, such as Sublime or Adam or even an idee like Web

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,250
storm, you can totally use that.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,290
I like visual studio code, so that's what I use.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,440
So in order for you to get Visual Studio code, simply go to this link that I'm going to provide you

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,830
and your resources and then hit the download format button.

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,310
Now, what this will do is this will trigger the installation, so simply choose the place where you

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,980
want to download the actual TVs code.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,960
So I'm going to choose desktop and this will download the zip folder for you.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,690
Then you simply just open up the zip.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,720
And now you'll have your visual studio coat application where you saved your zip folder.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,260
So now if I go to my desktop folder, I see it right here.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,310
So just double click to open it.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,960
And then allow your Mac to open visual studio coat because it's downloaded from the Internet, you need

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,860
to give it permission.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,270
Now, once you've given it permission, Visual Studio Code is up and running, so you now have the same

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,340
editor that I use.

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,530
The only thing I would suggest you probably do is add the code shell command to your terminal.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,060
Now, we'll explain more about what that actually is in a little bit later.

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,660
But right now, in order for you to add it, you simply hold command shift and press P, then you're

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,920
going to type command.

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,350
And here you'll see shell command install code command path.

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,680
So simply click that and then it will install the code command to your path.

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,910
Now, once you have your path set up, you are now able to use the code DOT command to open up files

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,030
and folders inside of your terminal, which we will do a lot in this course.

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,880
Now, what is the terminal?

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,340
Well, the terminal is actually going to be the main way that we navigate around our application, as

34
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,580
well as modify our files as you'll see in this course.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,870
Now, by default, Mac comes with a terminal.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,890
So in order for you to access it, simply go to your spotlight search and type in terminal.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,650
Once you have that, just open up the first thing you see, and this will be the terminal that you can

38
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,000
use throughout this course.

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,060
Now, with this terminal, what we need to do next is actually install node.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,380
Now, the easiest way for us to install node is actually to use something called End VM, which is node

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,310
version manager.

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,430
Now, in order to install and VM, simply go to the link that I'm going to provide you inside of your

43
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,260
resource folder.

44
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:06,710
And then once you navigate to this link, scroll down to this section called Installation and Update

45
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,210
and simply copy this line and then paste it into your terminal.

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,620
What this will do is this will clone down the NBN package and then add it to your existing shell, which

47
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,410
is the thing that we're running inside of our terminal.

48
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,270
Now, once we have an VM, we have to actually close our terminal and then relaunch it.

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,750
Now, once you have reopened your terminal type in commandership and pvm.

50
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,520
If you see nothing listed, then this means that SVM is not yet loaded to our shell.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,780
So what we have to do is we have to actually scroll down here and we can see inside of these instructions

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,470
right here on OSX, if we see that there's no end pvm script than what we have to do is first check

53
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,130
if we have a Basche profile.

54
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,770
Now, you can do this by simply typing Nanao and then this till the sign sgot Basche profile.

55
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,160
Now, if you hit this and nothing occurs, meaning that there is no Basche profile, instead of NENO,

56
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,120
replace this with touch and then run nano profile again because touch will open a new Basche profile

57
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,480
for you.

58
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:28,160
So inside of our profile, if at the very bottom we see nothing related to end pvm that we need to add

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,300
this line of running source Basche RC.

60
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,170
So let's just add that in right now.

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
You can also copy paste this in if you want.

62
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,000
Once we have that, we just need to save by hitting Command X. It'll ask us if we want to say we hit

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,890
Y and then we hit enter.

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:56,760
And now what we need to do is we need to type source Tilda Agbank profile to upload and rerun our profile

65
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,140
that we've just made changes to.

66
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,810
And now if we type in LVM, we'll see that there's something here instead of an PVM command not found.

67
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,630
So now we know we have an PVM.

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,560
So now what we need to do is actually install node using NBN, and the way we do that is we can actually

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
first figure out what node version we want to run.

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,360
So let's go to the node website, which I will link to you as well inside of your resources.

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,770
And here we'll see that the latest version is ten point one six point zero, so we don't need to actually

72
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,850
manually download this from the website we can use and VM.

73
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,240
So go back to your terminal and you can type in nvm install.

74
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,940
Ten point one six point zero or any other version of note that you want to use now, you can also type

75
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,540
in N.V. and VM install node and this will give you the latest version of Node.

76
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,920
So for us, I'm just going to use ten point one six point zero and now this will install the appropriate

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,540
version of node that we need.

78
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,870
Once it's done, installing what we need to do is make sure that we use it.

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,090
So in order to do that, we can just say nvm use ten point one, six point zero.

80
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,790
And now we'll be using the right version of note, we'll also see that MPM was installed as well and

81
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:20,390
NPM is what we're going to use to manage the packages, which are the libraries that we use inside of

82
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,860
our JavaScript applications.

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,910
So this is really good.

84
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,110
We have both of them installed now and we can check by typing No Dashkova as well as NPM Dashboard.

85
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,550
And here we see that we have both installed on our computer.

86
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,740
So at this point, it's actually perfectly fine to continue with the course.

87
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,100
You have node, you have NPM, you have your terminal and you have your editor.

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:48,950
Now, the thing is that I use Riaan instead of NPM Yohana, simply another package manager that Facebook

89
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,830
made during a time when Empt has some issues.

90
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:59,060
But NPM is perfectly stable now and both are pretty equal in terms of the features and the speed regarding

91
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,940
package management.

92
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,120
So if you want to use NPM and not install yarn, you can definitely do so.

93
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:12,050
You can simply look at the different commands with NPM that you need in order to run commands instead

94
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,730
of using the yarn ones that I do.

95
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,010
But if you want to use yarn, just go to the yarn link that I provide you and your resources.

96
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,950
Scroll down to the installation script and then copy that line right there.

97
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,590
Then you go back to your terminal, we clear it and then we paste it in.

98
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,410
And now this will install yarn into your computer now, once you have yarn, you just need to check

99
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,550
whether or not it's there.

100
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,770
So simply tienen yarn, dash v and if you see a version now, you also have yarn.

101
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,880
So now you're able to do everything that I do in this course with yarn and you can switch between yarn

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,020
and MP freely.

103
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,300
Ideally, in one project, however, you should use either one or the other.

104
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,970
You should not use both NPM and yarn in the same folder.

105
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,240
Now, keeping that in mind, you are fully set up to move on with the course.

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,860
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
