1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,840
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,030
I want to take a quick break here.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,010
Go grab a coffee, gravity.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,890
Just take a break from all the learning that you just did.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,750
And I want to talk to you quickly about imposter syndrome.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,860
It's this idea that you're not good enough, that things are too complicated for you to ever achieve

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,390
what you want to achieve.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,000
You look at other people, at other industry experts, and you say, I will never get there.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,210
But it's just a symptom of learning.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,010
This idea of you not being good enough simply means that, well, you're just not there yet.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,100
Things take time if you want to learn a valuable skill.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,200
Well, it's hard work.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,460
That's why it's valuable.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,750
Remember how you felt on the first day of going to school?

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,730
First day on a job?

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,850
It's the same experience, but over time, with repetition, with practice, you get comfortable.

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,130
You get experience.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,220
And you slowly start to lose that imposter syndrome.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,850
Now, this idea of an imposter syndrome is great.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,750
It means you're doing something worthwhile.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,630
So don't use it as a negative.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,700
Use it as an encouragement that you're doing something good, that you're learning in your stretching

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,240
your limits.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,440
So with this break, I want to propose that we do a quick exercise.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,940
I want you to stop the lectures again, grab a coffee, gravity, and head on over to our discord.

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,840
Now in our Discord server, if you've used it up up until now, that's great.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,560
If you haven't.

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,410
Head on over to the server and I want you to do something that I think it's super important to learning,

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,500
and that is using what you've learned up until now to actually teach someone or help someone.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,340
So you can go all the way to, let's say, the coding and courses section and pick a topic that you

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,360
want to help somebody in.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,540
So let's say you go to the Python channel and in here you'll have other students that are asking Python

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,590
related questions.

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,050
Now you can scroll through here and see if you're able to help someone, even though you may not have

35
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,760
the experience or the knowledge yet.

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,810
This idea of practicing and explaining what you've just learned to other people, even if you're not

37
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,020
100% certain, actually is beneficial to your learning.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,230
Because if you're never teaching, if you're never explaining and vocalizing and showing what you've

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,020
learned, you'll always be a beginner.

40
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,430
This idea of teaching what you learn is a very important concept.

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,580
So moving forward, as you go through the lectures, any time you feel like taking a break, hop on

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,160
over to Discord and help somebody.

43
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,160
Our motto here is that we're always kind.

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,420
We don't judge anybody.

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,210
We're all just beginners here.

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,090
We're all learning.

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
So don't be afraid to answer things.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,670
Because you got to remember, nobody's perfect.

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,540
Except for Yoda.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,980
Yoda is pretty perfect.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,230
All right, I'll see you on the next one.

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,770
Bye bye.
