00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,640
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,850
Some of you may have noticed that inside of your deployed application you cannot use the Google sign

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:07,940
it.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,150
The reason for this is because we have not added our new domain as part of the authorized list to use

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,620
that authentication service.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,050
So here, just copy the actual URL for your website that you've been given for.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, if I go into your authentication tab in Firebase, go to your sign in method and hit edit for

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,510
Google.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,760
And then down here inside of authorized domains, click add domain.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,630
Paste in that URL and now this should work.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
So now that it's added in, let's go back.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,750
And what we can do is open up our application, go to the sign in, hit sign in with Google.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,490
And there we go.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,890
We can now properly authenticate into our application with Google, sign it.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,900
So that's just one quick thing to note.

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:07,600
Remember, again, if you ever change the domain or actually want more of your subdomains or whatever,

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,780
if you choose to end up renaming this website and getting a new actual URL for this, you're going to

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,430
want to add that domain here as well.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,730
This is just those things that you have to do for these authentication services.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,080
So remember that keys them.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,480
And with that, let's continue with the course.
