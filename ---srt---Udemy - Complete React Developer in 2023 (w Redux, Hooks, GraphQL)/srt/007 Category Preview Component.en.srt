00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,290
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,170
In this video, we are going to start working on breaking out this nested route of shop inside of shop.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,320
We have mainly two different routes.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,700
We have the base route, which shows these different collection previews of our categories.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,900
And similarly, deeper down into the shop route.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,810
We also have the individual routes that point to each specific category that shows all the products

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,590
inside of it.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,470
So here, hat shows all of the hats and of course, jackets shows all of the jackets.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,570
But notice how this value is dynamic.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,040
What we're going to learn all of that in this upcoming section, but the first thing we want to do is

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,270
just figure out how to build this base section for our shop page.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,430
So let's go back to the application.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,440
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make a new component that is a preview of a category.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,090
So of course, I'm going to call this category preview inside of this folder.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,340
We need to set up our base files.

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:04,350
So I'm going to make a category preview that styles that source, and I'm also going to make a category

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,010
preview.

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,310
Dash component Dot GSX.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,030
Nothing new here.

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,440
The component is going to import in these stylesheet.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,810
And then we're just going to set up some base component category preview.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,750
Equals a functional component, and we're just going to export by default.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,850
Category preview.

24
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,820
Now, let's think about what this category preview is going to do.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,500
So this category preview is going to live at the sharp component level.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,100
Inside of shop component, what we're going to do is we're still going to receive this categories map

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,530
because we need to generate a separate preview for each of these different categories.

28
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,650
So that means that whatever's inside needs to receive both the title so that it can generate the appropriate

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,520
H2 title.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,220
And then it needs to create the appropriate container that shows the first four objects.

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,460
So that means that for our category preview, we can anticipate that we will receive both a title string

32
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,950
as well as a product's array.

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,830
Then what we're going to return back.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,960
Is we will return a div an inside of this div.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,940
Is going to be the content.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,980
So as always, we have an outer containing element and we always tend to call these the category or

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,270
the name of the component at least.

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,480
Dash container.

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,730
And once we have this now, let's think about what goes inside, so we know we have to display the title.

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,980
So I'm going to make an H2 and this H2 is going to contain a span and within the span is where I'm going

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,690
to have the title.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
And I'm going to uppercase it.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,730
Now, you might be wondering, why is it that we have a span inside the H2?

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,140
Well, remember this H2 becomes clickable and becomes a nav link for us.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,290
So what I want to do is I want to make sure that this only is clickable on the text, not the H2.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,980
The way that we're going to set up this container is that is going to use Flexbox.

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,400
So that's going to actually make it so that the entire H2 spans across the entirety of the width, which

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,910
we don't want.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,080
We don't want all that clickable.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,500
We just want the span and you'll see once we actually add in the styling.

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,160
So I'm going to add a class name here of title.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,720
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a div and in this div, this is where it's going to

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,240
contain all of the actual products.

54
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,660
So this I'm going to give a class name of preview.

55
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,030
And then what we'll do is we'll take the products away we receive.

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,290
I remember we want to filter out anything but the first four.

57
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,550
So here what I'm going to say is that I want to get some callback.

58
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,280
This callback is going to get the product, which I'm going to ignore.

59
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,600
So I'm going to use an underscore saying that I don't want to use it.

60
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,750
And then the second argument of this is the index, which is the index inside of the array.

61
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,570
So the placement in the array first element being index zero, second being index, one, third being

62
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,430
indexed to, et cetera, and onwards.

63
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,070
And what we want to say is that we want to filter it out if the index is greater than four.

64
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,770
So we'll say, Hey, keep it if the index is less than four, because greater than four, as we remember

65
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,860
with filter, whatever evaluates to being false is what gets thrown away.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,560
So here we're saying, hey, as long as the index is less than four, so the first four indexes because

67
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,990
it starts from zero, I want you to keep these products.

68
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,040
And then after we filter them out, then we can map through them.

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,430
So here we pretty much just do what we had before.

70
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,870
We're going to take our product and then we're going to pass it to some product cart component that

71
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,770
we need to import it.

72
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,400
So let's import in product card from.

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,950
The product car component, folder and file.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,940
And here inside, we're just going to render the product card.

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,830
And of course, we're going to give it the key of the product ID.

76
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,780
And then product goes to product.

77
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,970
Now, again, inside of your preview styles, I've included the file for you, so please copy and paste

78
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,110
that from your resource folder.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,260
So now that we have this, paste it in or we need to do now is use this category preview component.

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,430
So here, let's import this back into our shop component.

81
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,980
And here we can just say instead of importing the product card, we're not doing that anymore.

82
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,580
We're importing directly the category preview, which will replace the need for a lot of what we have

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:53,920
inside.

84
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,120
Now, let's just say category preview goes up one more into components.

85
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,180
Slash category preview component.

86
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,490
And now what we can do is start replacing this coat.

87
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,500
So instead, this fragment, I'm going to use a div, and for this div, I'm going to give it a class

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,340
name of the shop container.

89
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,760
And then inside of here, we don't need all of this fragment code or we do need, though, is we need

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,170
the actual objects.

91
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,560
So let me also fix this because instead of doing one line return, we now need to do multi-line.

92
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,470
The reason for this is because I need to set the products to a contest because I want to get this out

93
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,720
of my categories map using the title.

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,160
And then what I'm going to return is this category preview, which we've already determined needs to

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,880
utilize.

96
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,250
First, I'm going to pass the key for the title.

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,010
I'm going to pass it a title, which is the title, and then I'm going to pass a products, which is

98
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,760
products.

99
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,240
So now, if I save this, get rid of the need for the fragment up here, if we go back to our application,

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,860
here we see it.

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,530
Everything is as we want it to be.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,180
So we have our previews showing our four different elements.

103
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,350
Awesome.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
So this is a preview.

105
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,790
What we need to do now is actually start building out the next route, which is where when you click

106
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,610
this title, it takes you to the corresponding shops hats route and shows the full collection.

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,790
So let's figure out how to split up our nested routes now that we have our collection preview in the

108
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,750
next video.
