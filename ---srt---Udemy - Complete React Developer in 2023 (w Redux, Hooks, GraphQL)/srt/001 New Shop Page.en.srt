00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,850
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,390
In this video, we are going to start working on actually bringing some products into our application.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,900
And also being able to take those products and start adding them into our cart.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,670
We haven't built the cart.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,120
We haven't built the shop.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,370
We don't even have products.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,920
But throughout the next series of videos is where we will start tackling that with all of the information

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,780
and knowledge that we've learned so far and then flexing them so that we can actually start fleshing

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,440
out and building some really useful and interesting features to begin with.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,990
Let's go back to our application.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,790
Here, before we begin with putting any products inside of our database, it's easier if we just mock

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,170
this data inside of our actual code base directly.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,710
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to make a new file in the source folder called shot data.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,850
Dodgson.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,980
And inside what I want you to do is copy the shop data, JSON file from your resources folder and paste

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,580
it in here.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,610
It's really just an array that contains some hats, and it's a pretty simple structure.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,050
There's an ID, there's a name, there's an image URL, and then there's a price.

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,950
These are really what we're going to use to populate out a baseline for our actual shop page and then

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,730
from there we can start actually moving them and reconfiguring them.

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,310
But what I want to do first is just build in the key functionality before we start worrying about anything

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,340
more complicated to begin with, what I'm going to do is first set up a actual shop page.

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:48,430
So here inside of routes, I want to make a shop folder and inside I'm going to do shop component Dot

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,130
GSX.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,910
The shop component is going to replace the current shop temporary component that we've been using.

26
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,170
So as far as the shop component goes.

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,430
What is it really that it's going to be?

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,910
Well, if you think about it for now, at the very least, I just want to list out all of the different

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,620
products that are available.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,930
So I'm going to say Konst Shop is equal to a functional component.

31
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,920
And what I need to do is I need to import in the actual shop data.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,290
So I'm just going to directly import it first.

33
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,250
I'm going to say import shop data like this shop underscored data from.

34
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,520
And then let's go up to our actual JSON file.

35
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:48,060
Like so, so good thing for us is that with React, it's automatically going to import the entire JSON

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,710
file and then store it in this data.

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,350
So here you'll see that it just gives us the array.

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,880
Now, when I have this shop data, remember we're just going to try and optimize later.

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,320
I want to make a div.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,710
And inside of this div, for now, all I'm going to do is just say shop data dot map.

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,950
Give me the product, and all I want you to do is just return back.

42
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,000
Div.

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,320
With an H1.

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:27,830
And inside of that one, I just want to use the actual title value or the name value, sorry.

45
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,170
So let's do it and then let's structure this off of the product.

46
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,530
So let's show the name.

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,170
And the reason we want the idea, of course, is because we need to provide a key for our map.

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,430
And then I'm going to export the shop as the default export.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:58,560
And then inside of our app, Jess, I am going to replace this concert shop by importing in shop from

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,950
the roots slash shop slash shop component.

51
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,140
So now, as you can tell, it's the same name.

52
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,220
So it's still rendering.

53
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,900
We can save this.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,790
Let's go back to our application and let's go to our shop, right?

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,290
And here we see that our data is rendering it awesome.

56
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,420
So we have all of our data in here.

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:30,580
Now what we want to do is we want to start thinking a little bit more about what it is that we want

58
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,650
to do with this shop data.

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,750
So when we think about an application, chances are the shop data is not going to be hardcoded into

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,960
the application, but we're doing it for now just to make sure everything works.

61
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,100
We're just marking that data.

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,590
Eventually, that shop data is probably going to live in our Firebase fire store.

63
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,090
So what we need to do is we need some way of being able to fetch those products down from our outside

64
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,360
third party API, and then we want to be able to access it in these different components that need them.

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,410
Now, doesn't that sound a little familiar to us this concept of storing this data somewhere?

66
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,700
So what we can do is we can start setting up the actual storage using react context rather than starting

67
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,750
to actually set up the call for the data, just as we did with the user context.

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,530
We actually set up the actual storage first before we started actually setting up the separate call

69
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,190
for that data.

70
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,540
So we want to do the same thing.

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:43,120
So my challenge to you is to actually build out a similar set up of context using the products so you

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,750
can call it product context or products, plural context, and then just set it up and make sure that

73
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,290
all you're doing is you're using you state in a similar way.

74
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,800
But what you're setting is this default shop data.

75
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,250
So try that out yourself and then let's do it together in the next video.
