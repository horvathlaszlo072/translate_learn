1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,590
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,570
In this video, we are going to dive into the meat of the actual real code finally.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,160
So what we're going to do as we're looking at the app file.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,700
As I mentioned, the app DXC file, if you think back to our Index Dogs Farm, we were importing app

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,950
from this app file.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,910
So app here is actually the App Dogs and what App Dogs is that represents our entire React application.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,330
So we're going to dive deep into how this one file doesn't actually contain the entire application as

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,770
we build it.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,240
It's just that right now this is the main bulk of what the application represents because the application

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,870
is very simple.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,560
It's really much just this part of the website.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,210
So if you look at it, all it is with react is that we are importing the logo, which is the logo to

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,640
SVG, and we are also importing our Abduct CSV file.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,800
So this is also generated for us and it's what makes the logo spin and gives the background color and

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,810
then makes these the certain sizes that they are.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,030
That's all the CSS that's listed in here.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,120
So by importing it, we're saying, Oh, I want you to apply this.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,600
Yes.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,910
So that's being applied to this website now.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,790
Here you'll notice that there is this function, and this is very important because in React React is

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,200
pretty much just using functions to return the amount.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,010
That's all it is.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,830
This code is just some generic function called app that returns you.

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:38,960
This specific HTML that represents this function of app, and you can see this app function as a component.

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,000
So what is a component?

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:49,280
A component is pretty much a self-contained piece of code that returns some visual UI representation

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,230
of HTML UI being this thing that we can see and interact with.

28
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,780
Now, as we know with websites, anything we interact with is a combination of HMRC, RSS and JavaScript.

29
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,950
So this is no different here.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,370
It's just that all of this is contained within this function.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,330
So inside of here, if you look at this, this is pretty much just basic HMO.

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,580
We have a div, we have a header, we have an image and this image is being passed the source of our

33
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,120
logo.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,500
So our logo as which is just this icon that is spinning.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,690
And this image is being rendered inside of this header HDMI component.

36
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,180
And then there are some p tag here with some text inside, and then there's an anchor tag that points

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,020
to learn react very simple HTML and this function is essentially returning this demo.

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,480
So that's really all that's happening is that inside of index, Jess React is just saying, Oh, I want

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,400
you to render this app, and here this looks like an HDMI tag.

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,690
And the reason for that is because using React Dom were saying, Oh OK, this HTML tag is some function

41
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,330
code that will return us more.

42
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,290
Him, which is exactly what app JS is, it's returning us HD marker.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,710
So what we're looking at here is really just the HTML that's being rendered on the page.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:13,370
And if we update this, let's say I update this tag to say hello, my name is Yehovah.

45
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,200
If I save this now, if I go back here again, create racked up is just rebuilding and it is updating

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,780
this text now to say Hello, my name is e.y.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,960
You saw it's pretty automatic, but here what we're just seeing is that that's really all react is really

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,620
it's just code, so a function or a class, which we'll learn about later, that returns us back.

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,370
HTML.

50
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,780
That's really all react is if you really want to think about the very barebones of React, it's just

51
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,810
these helper functions that help us return HTML.

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:56,180
So it allows us to build websites and these UI in a very efficient componentes way components once again

53
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,490
being the self-contained representations of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

54
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,520
So this is really all that's happening here.

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,780
So with that, you pretty much understand actually all that React app has given us some of the more

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,880
nuanced things that go on, such as tests and the progressive web app stuff.

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,760
We'll explain later, but as far as the main bulk of what we're going to work on when we start converting

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,400
this create racked up application over to the Monster Rolodex project is just going to be around writing

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,260
these functions are these classes that return us back each demo, and that's all it is.

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
So now that you understand what create React app does?

61
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,840
There is one caveat I must mention before moving forward.

62
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,220
So a lot of the videos were done using an older version of Create React app.

63
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,630
Right now, I'm actually speaking to you in the present with the latest version of Create racked up.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,520
So when you go through, you'll notice that some of these files are slightly different, but honestly,

65
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,640
it's so insignificant it's pretty much all the exact same.

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,970
It's just that a couple of things have been tweaked and the placements are a little different.

67
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,500
But all the concepts you learn and everything that you see is going to largely remain the same.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,930
So definitely don't get scared if you see it.

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,080
Just understand that all the core concepts that you have are already now fully explained as to what

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,070
create React app is doing.

71
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,960
The older versions are doing the exact same thing.

72
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,180
It's just that create React app and Facebook like to change the way that they build things every once

73
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,630
in a while.

74
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,520
Not necessarily because it's more optimized, but sometimes just because they want to introduce some

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,590
things or remove some things.

76
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,190
But nothing is that significant.

77
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,060
99 percent of everything is largely the exact same.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,780
So now that you understand this, let's start actually building out our monster's Rolodex project and

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,810
getting really into the meat of our React application.

80
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,400
So before we start doing that, once again, Andre is going to just quickly dive into why you should

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,740
not eject by showing you what happens when you eject.

82
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,100
Once again, this is just a better understanding of what it is that our code is doing.

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,520
But here again, you understand that all react is is just functions that return a demo.

84
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,690
That's really all it is.

85
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,320
So with that, let's move to the next video.
