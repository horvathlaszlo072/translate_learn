00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:08,260
Hey, it's Andre here, I want to talk about an important principle, which is this idea of not overcomplicating

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:08,590
things.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,530
So far in the course, we learned a ton and there are so many more things, so many libraries, so many

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,450
tools that we can use and it's very, very easy to start using.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,870
Perhaps the latest react features the latest coolest library.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,350
Keep adding all these tools and trying to make your code look impressive.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,580
But that comes at a cost.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,940
Remember, when you're working on a team, when you're working with others, when you're working on

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:47,680
big projects, how many lines of code you write isn't indicative of how good of a developer you are?

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:56,290
I argue that the less code you write, the better it is, because every line of code means you need

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,240
to test that code.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,170
It could be buggy code.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a code that somebody has to read to maintain it.

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,410
So you want to make sure that when you write code, you're not doing things just to look impressive,

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,610
just to be clever.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,420
What you want to do is to keep things simple.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:22,090
Do you think that React Hooks is confusing, good, then don't use them, use class syntax because good

18
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,550
code isn't about what's the latest and what's the trendiest.

19
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:33,250
Good code is about writing really predictable, clean, understandable code.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
And senior developers understand this.

21
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,200
The cleaner your code, the simpler it is, the better it's going to do in the long term.

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:52,080
So remember, next time you want to implement Grauwe, QoL, react, router, react, hooks, context,

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,570
sabai styled components, just for your simple to do app, that's when you need to stop and reconsider.

24
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,990
Hey, don't overcomplicate keep things simple.
