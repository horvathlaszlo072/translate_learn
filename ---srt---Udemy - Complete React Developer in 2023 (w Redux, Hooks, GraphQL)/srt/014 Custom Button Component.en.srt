1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,570
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,690
In this video, let's finish styling our sign up form.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,120
So here I want to give this div a class name.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,980
And the class name is going to be signed up container.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,010
As for this one that contains the sign up with their email and password, I'm going to make this into

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,050
a span because technically speaking, our title, which I'm going to use an H2 instead of an H1, just

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:35,290
so that in terms of the HTML, it's a little bit more clear to web scrapers that this isn't something

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,730
as high ranking of a title as an H1.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,730
Someone needs an H2 here.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,030
I'm going to say something like Don't have an account.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,020
Like so because this is a pretty common format for a sign up.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,990
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a sign up form stylesheet, so I'm going to say sign

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,860
up form dot styles dot SAS.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,730
And inside, I am going to say that the styles will target our sign up for container.

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,880
And I'm going to give it display Flex.

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,410
Flex direction.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,130
Column.

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm going to set the width to three hundred eighty pixels and then I'm just going to target the H2.

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,340
And for the two, I'm just going to say that I want to give it a margin on the top.

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,430
And also, no margins on the side.

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,950
So just margin, top bottom know, left right.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,510
And then here inside of our sign up form component, I just need to make sure to also import in.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,770
That stylesheet.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,810
And I'll save this.

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,000
We go back to our application.

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,760
And there we go.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,420
We see that we have what we need inside of this for.

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,150
That's what we need to do is we need to now create this button component.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,240
So here we see that we have this button component.

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,070
Let's recreate this button.

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,760
So let's actually think about what this button entails.

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,630
We notice that this button has some custom styling, but we also know that there is this sign in with

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,380
Google button.

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,930
So this button and this button look the same other than the fact that there is a couple stylistic differences

35
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,070
in how they perform.

36
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,580
So there might be some consideration here for us to already think about making a general button component

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,790
that can adapt to the styling required for where it's used.

38
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,280
Let's check around and see if there's any other buttons anywhere here.

39
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,220
We see that we're still using a regular black button, and inside we notice that this button is a pain

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,310
now button, but this one is actually not as required for us inside of the application.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,190
We also notice that there is this same button that we had before, but it's inverted.

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
So if we check, we know that we have our black button.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,040
But inside of here, we also notice we have a default white button that when you hover, turns black.

44
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,010
So it looks like there are three types of buttons.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,600
There's this default block button.

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,250
There's the inverted button.

47
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,520
And then there is this sign in with Google button.

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,130
So now that we have these three different buttons, let's start coding out the button component itself.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,800
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to make a general button component.

50
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,230
So inside of components, let's make a new button component.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,470
So I'll make a button folder and we'll do button component dot GSX.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,790
Now, for those of you wondering what this button component?

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Shouldn't we name it something else, since there's already a button html element?

54
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,440
Well, for us, our button is actually always going to be capitalized because as we know, we can't

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,920
write different components that start with a lowercase letter.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,530
So our button is just a capitalized button, and that's enough for us to know that that is indeed our

57
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:04,860
button.

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:14,280
So here I can say Const Button is equal to a functional component that will return a button that has

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,810
some specific styling.

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,330
So it's still a button at the end of the day.

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,540
The only thing is just that we know we need some class name that we can target for this button to apply

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,620
our styling to it.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,030
And what we're going to apply to this is, let's call it a button container.

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,360
And then inside of our button, we want to use this button the way that you would use any button.

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:43,260
Meaning that whatever inside text or ones or P tags or spam tags you put in the button.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,870
We want to do the same inside of our button and that will just, of course, be the children.

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,460
So we'll just render the children inside of this button component.

68
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,290
Let's export this out by default.

69
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,090
And let's do a little thinking here.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,670
We know that we have three types of buttons.

71
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,760
So here what I'm going to say is that we know inside there's three buttons.

72
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,920
We have our inverted button.

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,020
We have our default button.

74
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,930
And then we have our Google sign in button.

75
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,870
So how do we leverage this button type in order to show styling for three different kinds of buttons?

76
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,090
Well, what we can do is we know that we're really just modifying this one button styling.

77
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:39,190
So really, perhaps we can control the styling by a class so we can have default styling for a button,

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,750
inverted styling as well as Google sign in styling.

79
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:52,840
And how we can do that is we can create some kind of variable, let's call it our button types, for

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,350
example.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,010
And here we know that what we're telling it to apply is classes so we can even do button type classes

82
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,680
as the name of this object.

83
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:14,950
And inside we know that, for example, if we get past some value like button type, if the value is

84
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:22,330
the string of Google, then we want to render this the class name Google sign in.

85
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,700
And if we got inverted, then we'll show inverted.

86
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:38,250
And what this does is this allows us to use a more readable and legible kind of input four button type,

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,250
but render whatever it is internally that we need in order to properly display this button type.

88
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,460
So through this one value that we're getting as a prop, we can now control how we want to render this

89
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,790
button.

90
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,330
It's just that right now we're only doing it by class name.

91
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,310
So let's just restructure or not restructure, but let's string interpolate button type classes like

92
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,610
so.

93
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,250
And in fact, in order for interpolation, this needs to be JavaScript, and I need to change my regular

94
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,720
quotes over to back decks.

95
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,560
But I'm going to say button type classes and then I'm going to call button type off of button type classes.

96
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,440
So button type here is expected to be a string.

97
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,140
And remember, with our button, we pass it all those other values that we were seeing inside of our

98
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,860
sign up form.

99
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,590
We had a type of summit.

100
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:39,540
So here in order for that to go through, we can do our other props and then we'll just spread this

101
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,310
in after the class name.

102
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,820
So now let's save this, so now that we have this class name set up.

103
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,620
How do we actually get the styling?

104
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,100
Well, as you guessed it, I've already done the styling for you, so create a button dot styles dot

105
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,820
SAS file.

106
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,380
And then inside paste in the button style sheet that I provide it for you.

107
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,000
So once you've pasted it in, you can see inside we have our button container, which is our class name

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,730
that adds all of these different stylings and hover effects.

109
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,070
But you'll notice that I have the Google sign in class name styling and the inverted styling that will

110
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,890
overwrite some of the styling that applies by default.

111
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,250
So now we just need to make sure that we import this in.

112
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,150
And then inside of our sign up form, let's import in the button itself.

113
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,510
And then all we need to do now is come down to our button.

114
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,400
And paste this in.

115
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,270
And now if we save this and we go back to our application.

116
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,310
We see we have our button, in fact, now just to confirm.

117
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,960
Let me add a button type which is equal to.

118
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,210
Let's say Google.

119
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,470
We come back.

120
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,510
We see it becomes a Google button.

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,540
And then if we changes to inverted.

122
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,640
We see we have an inverted button, so there we go.

123
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,900
We have our button component.

124
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm going to switch it back to the default, and it's the default.

125
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:24,910
Awesome.

126
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,040
So we've styled our sign up component as well as our button.

127
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,510
So now that we have all this set up, let's actually work on our sign up page and then we can finish

128
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,020
up this overall page for sign in and sign up.

129
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,020
Now there's two things left that we need to do before moving on.

130
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,500
The first is that we need to actually commit our code.

131
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
So let's go back to our terminal.

132
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,420
Let's add all the things that we did.

133
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:57,910
So here I want to say that I created the sign up component, the form input component, as well as the

134
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,990
button component.

135
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,740
And then let's push this up.

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,600
And the second thing that I want you to do is I actually want you to attempt to create this sign in

137
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,990
component here, all the signing component does is it takes an email and a password and it tries to

138
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,670
verify otherwise.

139
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,350
You can sign in with Google.

140
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,900
It looks very similar to our sign up component.

141
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,760
But what the sign in portion?

142
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,080
You may have to look inside of the Firestorm box a little bit to figure out the method.

143
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,360
But I want you to at least try and figure out how to replicate pretty much what we have here, but inside

144
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,330
of sign in and just trigger a callback for sign that you don't necessarily need to actually call the

145
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,750
method.

146
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,160
But at the very least, I want you to try and recreate what we did for sign up.

147
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,410
But here, create it for sign in because we ready have all the components we already know of the logic.

148
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,960
So this is a good chance just to practice everything that we've learned for building the most complex

149
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,640
component that we've built so far.

150
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,370
So good luck and I'll see you in the next video.
