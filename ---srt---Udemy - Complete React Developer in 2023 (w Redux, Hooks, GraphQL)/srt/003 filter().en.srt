1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,450
Now, the next one we're going to look at is Filter.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,340
So to understand filter.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,090
Let's go back to our browser console.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:22,850
So filter is very similar to a map in the sense that it's also going to take a function that gets iterated

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,050
over each element in our array.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:35,390
So let's do this again, except this time I'm going to say my array is equal to one three five seven

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,110
nine.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:47,530
Now, filter is exactly as it sounds, we want to filter out the elements in our array based off of

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,030
the function that we pass it.

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,090
And Filter will also give us back a new array instead of modifying my array.

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:06,280
So what we're going to do in order to use filter is we're going to write a filter and just like earlier

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,850
with Matt, we're going to get the element as the argument over function and what we're going to return

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,380
is actually a true or false value.

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,520
So let's say, for example, I wanted to filter out anything that was less than five.

15
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,610
Well, I would essentially say if the element.

16
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,620
Is greater than four, right?

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,800
So whatever returns true will be the thing that gets kept in our array, so whatever element we'll get,

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,030
Captain R.A. is based on whether or not the evaluation of this is true.

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,550
So if, for example, we just return true, what we would get back our whole array if we return false.

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,370
Right, we would get back nothing.

21
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:09,410
So if we want to just whatever was five or greater, then we would say as long as the element is greater

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,190
than four.

23
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,800
Because if the element is one, one is not greater than four, right?

24
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,480
So that will be false and that's why it'll filter out one and three.

25
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:31,970
And this array that we get back is a new array, my array is still the same array.

26
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:42,630
And that's what filter is, so remember, that filter also returns back a new array, except it filters

27
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:52,650
out the anything where the function condition returns false, anything that returns true, it'll keep

28
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,000
in the new array.
