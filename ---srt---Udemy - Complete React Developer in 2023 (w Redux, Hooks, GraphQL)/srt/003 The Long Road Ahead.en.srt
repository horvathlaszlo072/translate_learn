1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,870
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to an important crossroad in our path to becoming a great reactive.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,190
You see, we have two options here.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:21,810
The first option is we can keep going, we can keep learning, react syntax, small little tricks and

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,280
pretty much learn the entire documentation, which is right over here.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,830
So that like a dictionary, we understand every single thing about react every single tool in the library.

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,100
But here's the thing.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,480
You can do that on your own.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,490
You don't need me to tell you what the documentation says.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,400
And as a developer, you should learn how to read the documentation.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,740
However, I do understand that sometimes it's nice to have somebody show you how things work, how maybe

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,070
something that isn't clear online is explained.

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,700
So we're going to take a different strategy than most courses here, and I've talked about this before,

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,670
what we're going to do is we're going to try and simulate a real work environment.

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,010
What does that mean?

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,480
Well, moving forward, we're going to start off building our e-commerce website.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,320
We're going to build a full out online clothing shop.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,910
From start all the way to finish where we put it online, it's going to allow us to do a ton of things.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,140
But what we want to mimic here is how in a real life scenario, you would most likely be working with

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,210
somebody, perhaps a senior developer.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,370
So along the way, I'm going to ask you to code along, have your code side by side next to the videos

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,190
as we work through the project together and as we build the project, we're going to encounter different

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,300
problems, different things that perhaps we haven't learned yet and react.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,720
And slowly we're going to learn these things as we build the project because we could spend the next

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,380
20 hours just building five more useless projects that aren't impressive because they're things they

25
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,100
can do in a day.

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:13,000
What impresses employers and what gives you actual work experience is building these large projects

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,030
from start to finish.

28
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,620
So we're going to choose this path.

29
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:24,070
So if you feel like, hey, I feel like I only know maybe 40 percent of react, then that's OK because

30
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,360
we have a long way to go.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,410
I hope that you stick around, because by the end of this course, that 40 percent of knowledge is going

32
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,760
to grow and we're going to try and build something from scratch so that at the end of the day, you

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,410
don't just learn a list of tools, but you learn how to lead projects, how to explain to people how

34
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,780
react works, how to decide on good architecture.

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,520
It's time to get started.
