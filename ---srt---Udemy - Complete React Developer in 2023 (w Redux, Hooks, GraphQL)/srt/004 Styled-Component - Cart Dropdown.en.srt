1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,580
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,690
In the last video, we start our button, but now what we need to do is we need to style our car dropdown

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,350
and I'm going to teach you a new concept that works with star components as well inside of your styling

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,950
strategy.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,670
So first, let's create what we need for car drop down.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:27,680
We need to convert our car drop down styles that pass over to 8.6 X-File inside of car drop down.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,980
One quick thing I want to note is that I've actually left out a very small feature, and that feature

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,730
is that when you have no car items, what we should show is that there is some kind of message that

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,020
mentions we have no card items.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:49,160
So, for example, inside of car items, what we could do is say that if cart items Typekit length is

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,040
existent, meaning that it's greater than zero, if a value of zero evaluates to falsely meaning that

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,310
we have no card items, then we show the empty message.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:06,230
But when there is card items, then what we want to do is we just want to actually iterate through mapping

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,310
the card items to the corresponding cart item component, which is pretty much all we have done up until

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,670
this point.

16
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,380
After this, then we need to show some kind of empty message.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:25,220
So this is where I would add somewhat of a span and inside of the span I would say your cart is empty.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,420
And that is pretty much all we need in order to demonstrate that we have an empty cart.

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,720
So what I'm going to do is I'm also going to style the span as well.

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,700
So going back to our car drop down styles, let's talk about how we're going to convert this.

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,870
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to, of course, style and make a style component,

22
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,580
and to do that, we need to import in styled from style components.

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,700
Once we have this, what we're going to do is going to say, OK, I have this, what I want to export

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,490
out is the cart drop down container component, which is what this class pretty much reflects.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,300
And this is a stealth device because it's the parent level component.

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,290
I'm going to capture all of these different styles that we have.

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,000
And then what I'm going to do.

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:28,550
As I need to think about what I'm trying to also star here, these ones don't need any context anymore,

29
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,160
meaning they don't need to live inside of the car drop down container because the targeting is not specific

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,550
anymore.

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,970
We can now just create new components that reflect what they are, because now we know will be scoped

32
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,940
within our car drop down component thanks to star components.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,650
So here I can say export Konst empty message, which is actually that component that we had just made

34
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,070
inside of our car dropped out when it's empty and we can just copy these in like so.

35
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,640
And then I'm going to do the same thing for our carte items, something say export konst carte items.

36
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,560
And here you can call them items, container or car items.

37
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to call them car items, and here I'm just going to make sure to bring over these same styles.

38
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,860
And now what you've seen I've done is I've left this button for last because this button.

39
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:36,260
Is specifically targeting any buttons inside of our component, meaning inside of our car drop down

40
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,620
component.

41
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,320
So what you could do is you could say for any button, I want this stop.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,920
But let's say you wanted to target specifically our own button.

43
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,950
Not every button, but just our own custom button.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,530
The one that we made in our own component.

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,820
How would you do this?

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,930
Well, this is where we get a really powerful nesting ability and targeting select our ability inside

47
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,890
of stock components.

48
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:10,230
As I showed you before, each of these components get custom class names when small components actually

49
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,130
gets compiled.

50
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,200
If you remember when we looked inside the inspector, we saw that each of these different components

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,690
that we made using style components had a very unique, randomly generated string for the class name.

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,640
And on that class name is how these styles got attached, which is how we're able to make sure that

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,830
in our finely compiled excess, it doesn't actually conflict or clash.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,070
But this also means that style components actually knows what those new randomly generated class names

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,760
will be.

56
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,150
And the way that you actually target them inside of your styling for a stock component is you can directly

57
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,300
reference the style component that you've made itself.

58
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:56,070
So, for example, we have inside of this file, other style components, as in cart items, knows that

59
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,580
what comes before it is empty message and cart drop down container.

60
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,340
But what this also means is that you can actually target these inside of your style.

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,080
So if inside of empty message, for some reason you want it to target your dropdown container, you

62
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,510
can just do so like this.

63
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,270
You can say, Hey, I want to apply styling on any components that have this cart dropdown container

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,780
component inside of it as a child of empty message.

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,080
So this is where the nesting applies the same as selectors when you have nested like we have button

66
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,410
here.

67
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,210
We're only targeting buttons that live inside as a child of car drop down container.

68
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,010
What you're saying with empty message is you're saying, Hey, I want to target any heart drop down

69
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:44,760
container that is a child of empty message so you can target any style component and inside you can

70
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,770
overwrite and make nested stops.

71
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,670
So if you wanted to change the position, you can do so just like this.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,820
So what we want to do is we want to replace this button with our button component.

73
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,460
But the things you remember about our button component is that our button component renders a regular

74
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,830
component that in turn determines which of these three style components to render.

75
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,260
So in order to target all three of them, which could be conditionally rendered, we actually need to

76
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,630
import all three of our style component buttons.

77
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,420
So to do that, I'm just going to go up here.

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm going to paste this in, and I'm going to make sure that we're going to the correct component.

79
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,290
So we're going to go to button.

80
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,740
And then from button, we need to go to button styles.

81
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,720
So let's just make sure.

82
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,100
Like this?

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,110
And now we can copy all three of these.

84
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,140
And here we can say, OK, I want you to target base button.

85
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,640
I want you to also target Google sign in button.

86
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:57,770
And then I want you to also target inverted button, so if any of these three components get nested

87
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,760
inside of cart drop down container, then apply these stars to them.

88
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,460
And now that we save this well, we want to do is we want to make sure that we replace the correct components

89
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,010
inside of our styling.

90
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:18,760
So here I know I don't need carte drop-down anymore and I'm going to import and cart drop down container.

91
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm going to import an empty message.

92
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,270
And I'm also going to import in the cart items.

93
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,170
And now to replace the correct components.

94
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,080
So first, let's replace the diff.

95
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,770
Let's also replace the empty message.

96
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,980
And now let's also replace Carte items, which is also a do.

97
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,640
And now it looks like I have an extra day there.

98
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,250
So that's it.

99
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,340
We've updated our code.

100
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,880
Let's double check, make sure everything is working, including our new empty message.

101
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,230
Now, back inside our application, we actually see that I have a resolution error for getting this

102
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,680
component.

103
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,100
So it looks like what happened is I missed a slash.

104
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,470
And now, if we save this and we come back.

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,290
We see that our application properly loads.

106
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
We open up the car dropdown.

107
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,160
We see our empty cart message.

108
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,320
And when I add, we see that everything still works and our button still works.

109
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,370
So there we go.

110
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:46,610
The key takeaway here is that you can target inside of your style components different other stock components

111
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,430
as selectors.

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,850
So one important thing to note is that if you're going to use them inside of the same style file, just

113
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,270
make sure that whichever component needs to target an earlier one comes after.

114
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,860
Because if, for example, in cart drop down container, you try to target empty message.

115
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,580
Well, what you'll actually end up seeing is that this variable will not exist at the point of this

116
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,380
style component being initialized.

117
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,640
So that's an important thing to note.

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,130
But other than that, you have a lot of power in this ability to target your stock components, as well

119
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,600
as nested styling selectors inside of your styles now.

120
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,030
So with that, what I want you to do is try and start the next component, which is card icon.

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,910
Otherwise, we're going to do it and we're going to learn some more tips and tricks with style components.
