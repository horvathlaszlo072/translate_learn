00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,550
In the last video, we learn about nested routing and the outlets that in turn will render whatever

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,590
the nested matching route will be.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,280
So here what we see is that this directory component is staying persistent despite what gets rendered

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,390
as a sub route.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,780
So what we know then, is that perhaps we can leverage this pattern for our navigation bar in order

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,030
to continually render our navigation bar, regardless of what path we navigate to.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,010
So let's leverage this idea.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,290
Let's go back to our application, and let's actually think about what we need to create.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,220
We need to create some top level navigation component.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,060
I was going to call it navigation for now.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,380
We can rename it after.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,410
But for the purpose of this lesson, let's just make it very clear this navigation component is going

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,840
to contain a div inside of this div.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm just going to put some kind of div placeholder that has an H1 that says I am the navigation bar.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,150
We'll fill it with an actual navigation bar after.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,420
But with just this, we know that this is going to be some component that always lives on the page.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,660
It's going to be essentially the parent level component because it holds the navigation bar in sign

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:15,840
out.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,850
Whatever's underneath the navigation bar should render the home page or the shop page, respectively,

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,780
depending on the part.

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,590
So to do that, we're going to utilize an outlet.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,160
So why don't we set this up first and then I'll explain in detail what's happening in case this is a

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,910
little confusing.

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:42,600
So this navigation bar should be at the top level, so at the very top level, this should nest everything

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,970
and it should nest it under slash.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,310
And the element that it points to should be this navigation component.

28
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:58,060
Inside of here is where we now want to render our appropriate sibling components.

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,970
So instead, remember shop is nested under home.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,050
We don't want that anymore.

31
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,300
We want these to be siblings of each other.

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,120
And I want.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,810
This home, just to be explicit, let's just keep it home for now.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,380
And now let's nest these inside of here.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,630
Now, if we save this, well, we should see is that when we're on the home page?

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,150
We just see our navigation bar.

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,320
If I go to my home.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,740
I see the directory.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,220
If I go to shop, I see the shop edge.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,280
So so far, the navigation bar is persistent.

41
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,510
But when we learn on our website, we do want just this base, Pat, to show the directory instead of

42
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,040
having to go to slash home.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,140
So how do we do this?

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,750
Well, instead of pattern matching path like this, we can actually use the term index and index is

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,440
an attribute.

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,730
If you pass index like this, it's actually equivalent to saying index is equal to true.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
It's just shorthand.

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,800
But what this tells this route is that when you match just this slash, so with nothing on it, then

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,560
this should be the home component.

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,960
That's what you render at the outlet level.

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,420
So match this slash when it's empty as the base component.

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,140
So we know that we already have a parental component, but render whatever the base is inside of the

53
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,470
outlet.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,890
So here now, if we save this, we go back.

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,120
We see that we don't have anything we don't flash on, but we see our directory.

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,610
And now if we navigate to slash up.

57
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,960
We should see the director disappear and we see our shop page.

58
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,130
But the main thing is now we're persisting this navigation bar.

59
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,730
So this is actually our top level component.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,240
This outlet will now, in turn, render everything else in sight.

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,260
So we have no leveraged that specific pattern utilizing the outlet that we had previously in our home

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,510
component, but now we've moved it to the top level navigation component and this top level navigation

63
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,520
component is kind of like the template.

64
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,060
It essentially represents the thing that should always be present.

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,400
And the thing that we decided to be president was going to be this navigation bar component inside this

66
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,850
outlet.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,140
This is what we'll swap based on the remaining route matching inside and this pattern matching this

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,790
deeper nested route matching.

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,370
You can do continually, however, nested deep you go.

70
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,950
And that's the big advantage of rack, right?

71
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,310
Or dump.

72
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,690
It takes a little bit of time to wrap your head around this concept, but you'll get a lot of practice.

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,790
But here we can see how we leverage this outlet pattern now in order to persist.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,900
The navigation bar.

75
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,520
So we're definitely going to leverage this pattern a lot throughout the rest of this application in

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,190
the next video, let's style this navigation bar looks closer to what we actually have in our final

77
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,150
application and then we can continue building out our roots and building our pages.

78
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,670
So I'll see you in the next video.
