00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,770
Now that we understand progressive web apps, I just wanted to add a few closing thoughts.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,970
Progressive web apps have a great goal in mind, make Web sites faster and better for the user.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,790
However, as with all new technology, it still has some kinks to work out.

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,800
As you can imagine, it isn't really in the best interest of Apple, as we mentioned before.

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,200
That's why so far support is really slow right now for progressive web apps will improve over time.

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,390
But you have to be careful between the browsers, what works and what doesn't when building a progressive

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:48,340
web apps, things such as push notifications can be achieved on some browsers and not others, and push

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:56,140
API and the notification API that users push notifications requires integration with the backend.

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,050
That adds an extra layer of complexity.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,720
And does everybody love push notifications and getting bugged from an app?

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,940
I know that when I'm visiting a website, getting notifications to add it to my home screen is really,

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,510
really annoying.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,220
Did you actually ever download and add to home screen notification?

14
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,130
Companies like Twitter and Tinder used progressive web apps and companies like Lyft are really trying

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,880
to make their progressive web apps as similar as possible to their native apps, which is always a good

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,610
sign with these sort of technologies.

17
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,370
Be careful not to just get caught up in the hype.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,390
Every situation is different, and depending on your project goals, you may or may not benefit from

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,260
progressive web apps.

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,030
As always, decide if the effort is worth the benefit.

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,870
Luckily for most projects, progressive web apps does help because even if it's not all the features

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,980
that are being used.

23
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,580
The browsers that do support it will give a better experience for the user.
