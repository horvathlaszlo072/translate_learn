1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,420
In the last video we leveraged to download the Create React app package to help US scaffolds our React

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,020
Project Monster's Rolodex.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,370
In this video, we're going to break down and take a look at all of the different folders and files

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,440
that have been set up for us by Create racked up.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,290
So let's go ahead and open up our project.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,500
And inside what I want us to take a look at is the package that JSON file first.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,850
We see that there's a lot of these different files and folders that got set up for us.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,450
But let's just focus on the package JSON file first.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,070
Package Dodgson is a file that tells our application or tells any developer looking at the application.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,100
What are the different libraries or packages that this project needs in order to work?

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,580
All of this was set up for us by Create Racked Up because Create React app knows what the minimum required

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,190
packages are going to be in order to run a React application, and it's install all of them for us,

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,060
as well as a couple handy packages that make our lives easier.

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,770
So if we look at it, what was in store for us in dependencies is that there's some testing libraries

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,640
here, and these are really just ways that we can test the code that we write.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,610
We can take a better look at that later in the course.

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,600
We're going to talk about testing very extensively.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,510
Right now, it's important we see that there's react and react, Dom.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,250
Both of these are libraries that are very critical in order to run our React application, as well as

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,960
react scripts and web vitals.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,430
That's one I want you to ignore.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,920
React Scripts is the main one that we want to focus on.

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,620
React Scripts is the kind of package helper that create React app gave us so that it can make our life

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,860
easier when it comes to doing all the different things we need to to develop a React application.

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,790
These React scripts are just different tools that help us leverage these new scripts that were generated

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,400
for us start, build, test and object.

28
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,310
What you'll notice is that they are just calling the React Scripts library and then calling one of these

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,910
commands.

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,520
So Iraq scripts was installed in order for us to actually leverage the scripts themselves.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,990
And what React Scripts does is it helps us better build our application and develop against it using

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,610
these four different commands.

33
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,960
So let's start with start.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,910
What to start to start will take all of the files that we have written for our React application, and

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,100
it will run them in a local development environment so that we can actually test it in the browser.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,140
So in order to run this, what we need to do is go back to our terminal and use your package manager.

37
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,320
So I'm using yarn.

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,410
You can use npm.

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,240
It's totally up to you.

40
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,120
I prefer yarn and I'm going to say yarn.

41
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,390
And then the name of the script, which was start.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,120
Now here you'll see that it said reacts scripts start.

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,960
So this, of course, was what was inside of Package Jason for that script, which was start.

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,440
So it actually runs the full command right here for us.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,440
And what you'll see is that it's starting the development server.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,140
So as I mentioned, what it's doing is it's taking all of the files that live under our source folder,

47
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,850
the source folder being the entry point for the actual code that we're writing for React app.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,090
Inside, there's a bunch of these files that we're going to go over.

49
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,060
But what it's doing is it's just taking all of this and it's building out the actual React application.

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,930
And now if we go to our browser, we see that at localhost 3000, which is where react scripts start

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,110
hosts to the specific port on our computer of 3000, and it will show us our application.

52
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,720
It's a very simple application.

53
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,480
It's just a one page with a spinning logo and then some text.

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,240
So let's understand what it is that reacts scripts star is doing for us.

55
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,880
Going back to our project, we see that there's a source folder and inside are all these files that

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,660
were built for us.

57
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,790
These are the minimum files required in order to actually use React.

58
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,280
So let's take a look at what's happening inside.

59
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,340
The entry point for every React project is the index, such as file.

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,410
Just like any project index, duchess just says that index being the first file that we want to look

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,390
at, which is JavaScript related, dodges this file inside imports a couple of these libraries that

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,190
again create racked up a set up for us.

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,770
The main one is react and react on these two libraries are very critical in order for react to work.

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,240
You want to see react as kind of the underlying engine.

65
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:49,470
So it's the engine that actually does all of the work when it comes to how React functions as a website

66
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,850
builder or not just a website builder, but essentially an application builder.

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,830
Now why do I say application?

68
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,410
Well, this is where we look at the second library.

69
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:08,100
React, Dom, React Dom is related to the web Dom being the document object model in web related projects.

70
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,520
So react Dom is these different tools that help us actually build web applications?

71
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,030
React is the engine that runs how these applications get built.

72
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,990
React Dom is specifying that that engine should be directed towards web related applications, though

73
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,320
these two libraries combined is what actually allows us to build out all of our web application in React.

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,880
So you might be wondering, well, is there other React related libraries for building out other things?

75
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,430
Of course there's React Native, which is for native mobile applications you might have heard of React

76
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,820
Native.

77
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,350
There's also a virtual reality application tool that you can build, also leveraging the React engine.

78
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,460
So that's why for our web application, we want both react and react off.

79
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,660
And both of these libraries get included with Create React app.

80
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,570
We're going to deep dive into what each of these do a little later.

81
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,860
For now, we just need to understand that they are provided for us and we need to leverage them in order

82
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,360
to build a React application.

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,690
We also import index the SS, which is just as the SS file that is also built for us by default.

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,790
There's this app, which we're going to take a look at a little later and then this report Web Vitals.

85
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,090
Again, we're just going to ignore the report.

86
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,580
Web vitals and what we're going to look at is the code right here.

87
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:33,140
So what this is saying is that it is saying that we are want to leverage this React library and we want

88
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,940
to render.

89
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,970
So again, I don't want you to get too bogged down about these methods that get used because we're going

90
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,350
to really deep dive into it later.

91
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,800
But for now, what I want you to see is that all this is doing is it is rendering out this code right

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,650
here and inside of this is the app.

93
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,350
Now, I want you to think of the app as the entire React application.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,930
We'll go into all the details later, but for now, conceptually, just understand app right here is

95
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,880
our entire React application.

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,950
This React Dutch strict mode.

97
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,430
This is something that create React app has generated for us, and strict mode just means that inside

98
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,360
whatever's inside of this strict mode, these two tags here, you're going to essentially add these

99
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,430
additional checks and warnings that React says in case you're using or deprecated code.

100
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,140
So the reason for this is because ract, of course, is at the latest version, which is 17 right now,

101
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,600
18 is just about to come out.

102
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,490
And there are certain features that are being deprecated with these new React versions.

103
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,460
Essentially, a lot of different teams are still using those old versions of the code, and strict mode

104
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,180
just says, Hey, there are some things I don't want you to use.

105
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,220
I want to be very strict about you not using some of those things.

106
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,560
So what it's saying is that anything inside that's really related within this tag that says react on

107
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,130
strict mode.

108
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm going to throw warnings about those specific things or I'm just going to outright not let you use

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,520
them because they're deprecated deprecating meaning that the React team doesn't support them anymore.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,890
In the new version of React.

111
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,320
So really, that's all that's happening here.

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,070
So react.

113
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,780
Dom, of course, is again the library and it's saying, Hey, I want you to render the application,

114
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,670
but where do you render it?

115
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,420
I want you to render it finding some document element with an ID of root.

116
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,520
So where is this happening?

117
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,930
Well, this is actually happening inside of the indexed HTML.

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,560
Now you might be wondering, where is our next HDMI alpha?

119
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,860
This is actually inside of the public folder.

120
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,250
So the public folder is also generated by Create racked up for us and index.

121
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,110
The amount is like any index HDMI file in any application.

122
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,020
It's just the basic HTML file that represents the applications entry point.

123
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,520
So in here, you of course, have all your different had tag your meta tags and all of the typical web

124
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,650
application related files that all get built for you or not files, but necessarily, but the HTML components.

125
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,690
And down here in the body, which is where I want you to focus, you'll see that there is this div and

126
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,700
this div has an ID of root.

127
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:18,710
So what's happening here is that are index star Jess is looking for some element with an I.D. of root.

128
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,120
And as we see in the index symbol, this div has the idea of root.

129
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,940
So what react to saying is, Oh, I want you to take that div and I want you to replace that div and

130
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,630
render into it our entire React application.

131
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,570
And that's what this is doing right here.

132
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,310
So that's pretty much how React actually works with him as a whole.

133
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,900
In fact, you can actually easily see that let's say we write something underneath here, let's say

134
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,590
we just add an H1 and inside I say hello everyone.

135
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,470
If I save this, what'll happen?

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,680
And one of the benefits of Create React app is Create React app will actually rebuild our application

137
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,240
for us.

138
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,030
And what we'll see now is that it is updated and down here.

139
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,920
You see the Hello Everyone text.

140
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,340
So what you'll notice, though, is that this is living outside of our React application.

141
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,000
And this is perfectly normal because all again, this index jazz file is doing is it is saying, Oh,

142
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,910
what I want you to do is I want you to find some element with the idea of roots and essentially render

143
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,750
inside of it.

144
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,180
This react application.

145
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,340
So that's what's happening right here, but below it is another perfectly valid HDMI tag with an edge

146
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,610
one.

147
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,660
It just doesn't have to live inside of our reactor application, so it lives outside of it directly

148
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,710
as a sibling.

149
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,170
Which is why you see right here, this is living outside of our reactor.

150
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,700
So that's what I want you to understand about React.

151
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,480
React is just some way for us to actually just build react applications into an HDMI file, but that

152
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,940
doesn't mean that all of the other HDMI is not valid.

153
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,380
No, it's perfectly valid.

154
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,600
You just have to understand that everything lives inside of whatever you're rendering, which in our

155
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,580
case is all within the app.

156
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,560
Now, throughout the course, we will break down what each of these libraries do, and we'll take a

157
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,460
much deeper dive.

158
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,210
But for now, I just want to give you a high level idea of what it is that create React app.

159
