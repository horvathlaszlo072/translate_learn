00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:08,120
In this video we're going to talk about get and get hub and source control.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,530
Now you might remember get hub from our previous section where we used it to put the Web site online

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,820
but I'll show you that it is so much more than that.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,690
More importantly getting get hub is used by most professional companies and it is a skill that is expected

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,700
to be known by all developers now.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,460
So this is an important section one of the first things most developers have to do on their first day

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,030
at the job is to MIT something called a pull request which uses get and get help.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,380
We'll get through that.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,580
In this section don't worry you're going to learn all of this and it's going to make sense.

10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,600
Let's first start with source control.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,180
Up until now we have only worked on small files.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,260
No team members just ourselves.

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,470
Just a couple of files.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,410
But in real life you're most likely not the only developer on a team.

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,900
Most likely the projects are huge.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,060
There's many many files.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,670
Source control allows us to make sure that multiple people can work on the same file from different

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,320
locations.

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:22,480
Think of it as Google Docs that allows people to collaborate on one document but enough talk let's actually

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,470
check it out.

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,410
I have over here set up two folders.

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,720
One is for myself.

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:36,580
Andre who just started a new job but X company and I have MRC here who has been working at the company

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,750
for a while and she has project files over here.

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm actually using the files from our background generator video now without get or get help.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,830
What I can do is just copy and paste these files so I have whatever Marcy has and we can start working

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,860
on these files.

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:02,470
I can have my developer environment here with my terminal and my Sublime Text and I can work on whatever

29
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:09,560
changes that need to be made on the app and Marci over here also has her own version where she can work

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,520
on it and we're both working on the same project but let's say that both Marcy and I are working on

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,510
this project and she decides to change the project name from gradient background to super background

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,680
and at the same time in my project I decide to call this cool background.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,740
Well now you'll have to set up a meeting between myself and Marcy and decide how we should change the

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,880
code.

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,490
And this is a small example but you can imagine that as different programmers work together there's

36
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,710
always going to be this issue of one person changing one thing and another prison changing.

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,590
Another thing.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,510
This is where source control came in and social control is a way to control this where we have one place

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,260
instead of our own computers.

40
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,350
And this case is just represented by the folder that I have in here instead of each of us having a copy

41
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,480
of the project with source control.

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,370
We have a copy of the project but there is a centralized location up somewhere maybe owned by the company

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,960
or somewhere on the Internet that has the ultimate version that we each talk to to make sure that we

44
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:35,390
each have the same version getting get hub is a way to do this to be able to use source control and

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,870
as a matter of fact it's the de facto way of doing this.

46
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,540
So like I said before this is most likely the tool you'll be using every single day at your workplace

47
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:54,140
so if I go to the github Web site here what it allows us to do is it's a place a central place that

48
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:04,360
both Andre and Marcy can talk to so even though we work on the same files the same project I can ask

49
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,650
this central location such as GetUp.

50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,150
Hey has Marcy made any changes.

51
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:18,590
And Marcy can ask hey has Andre made any changes and every once in a while you'll get something like

52
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:25,490
this where we have cool background and super background where we have something called a merge conflict

53
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:34,250
what get Hub allows us to do is say hey I noticed there is a merge conflict I see that you guys have

54
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,850
both changed your background I don't know who's right but here's the information.

55
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,840
Andre Marcy Can you guys talk amongst yourself and figure it out.

56
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,130
That's pretty much workflow.

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,710
So let's actually see what this looks like.

58
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,230
The first thing we want to do is set up a github account.

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,340
If you haven't done it in the previous exercises you absolutely should start to get hub account.

60
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,640
It's free.

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,220
And like I said before if you're a developer you just need to have it it's where everybody puts their

62
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,110
projects it's where you work you'll be spending a lot of time on this Web site.

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,500
You might remember that when we had the get Hub project I also told you to get get hub for desktop

64
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,570
although we use that to make things simpler.

65
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,480
During that video this is actually not the recommended way of doing it.

66
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:34,620
It allows you to visually see and interact with get hub but it's kind of looked down upon by employers

67
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,360
and most people use the terminal or the command prompt to actually do it.

68
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,730
So I won't be teaching you this way just because I think it's bad practice and getting used to the terminal

69
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,440
is important.

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,460
I'm going to close that and we're gonna get the start the very first thing we're gonna do is we're going

71
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,910
to click on Start a project and here we're going to call it whatever you want we'll call it background

72
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:07,280
generator and you also want to leave it as public and we want to click on initialize this with a read

73
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,580
me and we'll click Create repository.

74
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,880
And what that does.

75
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:18,200
Well we've created a new project on GitHub and here the read me which is just a file that describes

76
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,950
your project.

77
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,350
You can see that it's here.

78
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,320
We can type into the read me whatever we want and I'll describe our project.

79
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,420
But let's go back if Marcy.

80
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,320
Let's say Marcy has been working at this company for a long time.

81
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,420
I'm actually gonna remove my files here.

82
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,700
Marcy has been working at this company for a long time and the employer finally decided hey we need

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,630
to use get hub.

84
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,420
We're going to hire this new guy Andre.

85
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,210
We want to make sure that you both can work on it on the project together without any issues.

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:59,740
Can you put the project up on github so what Marcy will do is she will go to get help create background

87
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,320
generator and then she's going to click right over here to clone or download and she's going to make

88
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,880
sure it says use HDD P.S. And from here you just click on this button which copies this link to your

89
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,520
keyboard then Marcy goes to her terminal.

90
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:27,160
And right now we're in documents we want to have the project in the Marcy folder so I'll C.D. into Marcy

91
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,120
if I click Elyse I see that yet I have my files.

92
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:42,440
Now the first command that we're going to learn is called Get clone and then copy and paste what we

93
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,770
copy from the Web site.

94
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,540
We're just saying hey clone this project from get hub dot com.

95
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,000
So I press enter and there you go.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,890
Everything is downloaded.

97
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,080
If I go back to the folder now I see that I have a background generator.

98
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,970
If I double click this you'll see that I have a dot get folder here that's actually hidden.

99
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,070
You might not even see it on your laptop if you don't have this feature on your computer enabled but

100
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,700
this dog get now allows me to communicate with GetUp.

101
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,270
So what we can do now.

102
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,840
Marcy can copy and paste these files and put it into the background generator.

103
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,680
Now let me show you the next get command.

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,020
Marcy right now if we see she's in her folder but now we need to go into background generator because

105
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,030
if we do any gate commands here.

106
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,740
Well it won't work because it's not a good project.

107
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,560
We need to actually go inside of the project that was created on github.

108
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,820
So I'm going to S.D. into that directory notice here.

109
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,150
I have my terminal set so that it actually shows me what get hub location I'm in and I'll explain one

110
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,600
master means later now that we're here we can look at all our files.

111
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,810
Yep I see that now I have my read me which I created on GitHub plus the files that I copy and pasting

112
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:14,250
we need to sync this so that if I go into my background generator instead of the read me files Marcy

113
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:26,300
can put up her files on GitHub the way we do that is our second command get status it tells us that

114
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,870
we have on tracked files that is we have indexed not a Schimmel script yes and style that are on tract

115
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,740
and it says use get ad file to include while you will be committed.

116
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,680
So now that we see our status of what we have in our folder we can say get ad and the file name so I

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:10:02,560
can do index dot paste email get had script digest and get ad style that CSX.

118
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,410
Let's clear this so we can see it.

119
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,420
And now I can do get status again just to see what our status is.

120
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,630
And now I have your branches up to date changes to be committed.

121
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,290
You see that now with ad we've said hey we want to add these changes.

122
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,050
We have new files that we've added and says to be committed.

123
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:35,630
So the second step is to do something called Get commit and get commit says hey I'm committing that

124
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,630
these are the changes that I want to make to get hub.

125
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,040
And it allows you to pass a message so that on get happy it'll show the message.

126
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,300
When Andre comes back in he can say oh Marcy added these files and this is the message and we do that

127
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,710
by doing this.

128
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:03,110
And within here within the double codes I can say adding starting Project close the bracket press Enter

129
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,810
I'm going to clear this.

130
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,430
Now there's one last step.

131
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,070
We've added.

132
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:16,490
We did get add to add our changes then get commit to commit and say yeah we're locking in those changes.

133
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,540
And then finally we need to let get hub dot com know that these are the changes.

134
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,130
So we do get push

135
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,690
and there you go.

136
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,440
It has now been pushed to this repository.

137
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,700
So if I go back and I refresh look at that it's the same thing that we did when we put up our first

138
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,930
Web site online.

139
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,230
But instead of using the desktop version of Get hub we use the command line and now we have our project

140
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,800
which is very good.

141
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,530
Now let's go back to our example.

142
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,830
So Marcy has been working on this project.

143
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,540
There's a good repository.

144
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,990
And I just joined the company and now I need to start working on this.

145
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:10,350
What do I do now I need to access GitHub and get the copy of background generator the way I do that.

146
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,820
Well I go into my folder

147
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:23,910
and I do the same thing I do get clone and then I copy and paste the repository just like before

148
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,280
get clone and clone the repo.

149
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,400
And there you go.

150
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,960
If I go back to my folder look at that I have a background generator so we're both working now on background

151
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,940
generator but not off of each other's files we're working with whatever version is on github.

152
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,220
All right.

153
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:55,320
So now more realistic we go back to working and on the first day of my job I say I'm going to change

154
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,140
the greenish background title.

155
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:06,360
Actually the h1 tag to cool generator if I save this and I do get status

156
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:18,050
Oh well I'm not in a good repository right now if you remember I have to go into background generator.

157
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,090
Let me open that up a bit so you can see.

158
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,800
There you go again.

159
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,950
These get commands won't work if you're not in a folder that has the dot get folder.

160
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,150
So let me do that C.D. into background generator.

161
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,970
I'm going to clear this and I'm going to say get status and look at that.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,340
It tells me that I've modified index not ACM Alpha and if you remember I will say Get had I only have

163
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,440
one file I can do it next dot A.T.M. but if I want it if I had multiple files and I want to just commit

164
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:59,330
all them on once I can just do the period so I'll do that and then get commit and I'll add a message

165
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,030
changing Title I press enter.

166
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,930
Now clear this.

167
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,290
OK.

168
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:15,720
And again I do get push and it looks like everything went through.

169
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,360
So let's open that up and check it out.

170
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,610
I now refresh here

171
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:30,350
and what we haven't seen any changes but we now see that we have three commits.

172
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,120
We have the initial commit the adding back project that MRC did.

173
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,550
And it shows you all the files that were added and if I go back I have the changing title commit and

174
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,680
now I see that yeah.

175
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,750
Andre just changed the background generator which is in red too.

176
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,600
Cool generator.

177
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,130
So as you can see we have a history of all the changes and we can always go back if there's any mistakes

178
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,570
but there's one issue right now.

179
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:13,580
If I go back to the code and I go to Marcy's computer I see that well she still has a background generator

180
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,040
here.

181
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,070
Why is that.

182
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,190
Well because her computer doesn't know that.

183
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,350
Get hub has been updated.

184
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:28,070
The next command I'm going to show you this is the last one I'm going to show you in this video is get

185
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,150
pull.

186
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:38,480
So remember get push to push the changes to get Hongkong and get pull to pull Whatever's the latest.

187
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,470
So I do get pull.

188
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,250
And there you go.

189
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,400
You see over here that it shows me that index.html file was changed.

190
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,420
Now you see that my title has been changed to cool generator.

191
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,090
Let's just say that Marcy saw my first change and she really really likes how I've added cool generator.

192
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,880
But I think she wants to make it capitalized again.

193
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,740
She's going to save that.

194
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,900
She's going to say get status.

195
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,380
All right.

196
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,900
I have my index that a simple file get and then get commit.

197
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:29,490
And off the message cap a two lies title and then get push.

198
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,050
There you go again.

199
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,410
I go back I refresh and now there's four commits.

200
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,470
And we see that capitalized title is the new changes the first day of work is done.

201
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:53,280
I come into the next day of work and while I want to start with whatever the latest project is of back

202
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,810
on generator let's say Marcy worked all night to change that title to cool capitalized I want to make

203
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,030
sure that I have the most updated version.

204
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,660
So what I do is when I get into work in the morning I'll say well I want to make sure that if there's

205
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,150
any changes that Marcy made I know about then so I'm going to say get pull and notice here how the titles

206
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,970
going to change after I do the pull and now I click to Sublime Text.

207
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,200
And there you go.

208
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,940
Cool generator.

209
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,440
All right.

210
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:33,000
And the next video we're going to expand on this and show you what happens if both Marcy and Andre make

211
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,780
the same changes.

212
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,000
What does get hub do.

213
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,240
I'll see on that one by.
