00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.07
- [Instructor] Let's begin by setting up

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:03.06
the MongoDB environment.

3
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:06.01
We could download and run MongoDB locally,

4
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:08.07
but then when it comes
time to publishing the app,

5
00:00:08.07 --> 00:00:10.02
we will need to host it separately

6
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:12.03
or find a third-party host for it.

7
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:14.05
Might as well do that now to save a step.

8
00:00:14.05 --> 00:00:18.04
We will use a service that
offers free hosting called mLab.

9
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:21.00
Please head over to mlab.com,

10
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:23.04
then please create an account or log in.

11
00:00:23.04 --> 00:00:27.01
Once you've logged in, if you
have any previous databases,

12
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:29.03
you can see them listed here.

13
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:32.06
Otherwise, let's select Create new.

14
00:00:32.06 --> 00:00:36.07
I'll leave Amazon selected
and then select Sandbox.

15
00:00:36.07 --> 00:00:38.08
But you can use any other
option that you like,

16
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:41.04
as most of them offer free services.

17
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:43.06
Then I'll select Continue.

18
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:47.03
In my case, I'll use US East

19
00:00:47.03 --> 00:00:48.08
and I'll hit Continue again.

20
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:52.08
And I'll call my database learning-node,

21
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:54.08
but you can call yours whatever you like.

22
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:57.01
Let's confirm, make sure that it's free,

23
00:00:57.01 --> 00:00:58.08
and then we can submit the order.

24
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:01.09
Within a few seconds,
the database is created.

25
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:03.06
Let's click on it.

26
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:06.03
The first thing we'll need
to do is create a new user

27
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:07.08
since that's what we'll use

28
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:09.08
to access the database from our app.

29
00:01:09.08 --> 00:01:11.04
So let's select User.

30
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:15.02
Then let's click the Add
database user button.

31
00:01:15.02 --> 00:01:18.02
Since this is just for learning
purposes and not production,

32
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:23.05
for the username and
password, I'll just use user.

33
00:01:23.05 --> 00:01:27.00
And then I'll hit Create.

34
00:01:27.00 --> 00:01:29.01
We can see our user is now listed.

35
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:31.08
At this point, we're ready
to get Node connected

36
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:33.02
to our new MongoDB.

37
00:01:33.02 --> 00:01:36.06
To do that, we will need to
use a package called Mongoose.

38
00:01:36.06 --> 00:01:38.06
Let's look at that next.
