00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.02
- [Alex] We've covered many
of the basics with Node

2
00:00:03.02 --> 00:00:05.08
and we looked at many more
advance features as well.

3
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:08.04
This resulted in creating
a basic but robust

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:12.05
chat application where
I'm able to post a message

5
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:15.02
and have it automatically
synchronize across

6
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:24.04
several different
browsers using Socket.IO.

7
00:00:24.04 --> 00:00:27.06
With automatic notifications and updates,

8
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:31.00
we also looked at database
frameworks and providers

9
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:36.06
such as our mLab database
that's using MongoDb.

10
00:00:36.06 --> 00:00:39.06
And I hope you have a good
understanding of the differences

11
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:42.07
between synchronous and
asynchronous code at this point

12
00:00:42.07 --> 00:00:45.02
and how Node shines along with JavaScript

13
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:47.09
when it comes to working
with asynchronous code

14
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:50.07
and the various options we
have for working with it

15
00:00:50.07 --> 00:00:54.04
such as callbacks, promises, async/await.

16
00:00:54.04 --> 00:00:57.01
And finally we ended up with
a new way of development

17
00:00:57.01 --> 00:00:59.02
called test-driven development.

18
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:02.00
If you enjoyed developing
this chat application

19
00:01:02.00 --> 00:01:04.06
while working with both the
front end and the back end,

20
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:06.07
I suggest working with framework such as

21
00:01:06.07 --> 00:01:09.04
React or Angular to develop that further.

22
00:01:09.04 --> 00:01:11.03
And you can check out my course,

23
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:14.05
Building Angular Apps and
Node Apps with Authentication

24
00:01:14.05 --> 00:01:17.00
to explore these concepts
further as well as

25
00:01:17.00 --> 00:01:19.08
introducing authentication
into your application.

26
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:22.06
Good luck with your future
Node and web development

27
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:24.01
and thank you for watching.
