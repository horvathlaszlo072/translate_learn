00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.03
- [Instructor] Now that we have

2
00:00:01.03 --> 00:00:04.00
a good grasp of reading
files from the file system,

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:06.02
let's move on to trying
to read directories

4
00:00:06.02 --> 00:00:07.09
with the file system as well.

5
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:10.04
Let's create a new demo file.

6
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:17.08
And once again, we'll need
access to the file system.

7
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:21.04
And so I'll require an fs.

8
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:22.06
And we'll use a function from

9
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:26.02
the file system called readdir.

10
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:27.02
The first parameter we'll need

11
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:29.07
to pass in is the location we want

12
00:00:29.07 --> 00:00:31.06
to read our directories from.

13
00:00:31.06 --> 00:00:37.02
So let's use Drive C as an example.

14
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:39.01
Then once again, we'll create a callback

15
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:45.02
that takes in an error and data.

16
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:50.00
And then let's console-log the data.

17
00:00:50.00 --> 00:00:55.03
Let's save that, and I'll
use nodemon to run demo.

18
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:56.08
And you can see we're getting all

19
00:00:56.08 --> 00:01:00.00
of the directories inside our Drive C.

20
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:03.02
As you can see, reading directories
is very straightforward.

21
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.08
Next let's take a look at writing files.
