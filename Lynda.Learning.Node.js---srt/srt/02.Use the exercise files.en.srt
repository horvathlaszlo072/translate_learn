00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Instructor] I've
downloaded the exercise files

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:04.00
and placed the folder on my desktop.

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:05.07
Let me show you what's inside.

4
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:06.09
Here we have the folders containing

5
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:08.08
the finished source for each project

6
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:10.01
that we'll be developing.

7
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:13.02
For example, 02_01 contains a source

8
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:16.01
for Chapter 02, Video One.

9
00:00:16.01 --> 00:00:17.08
If you would like to load a project

10
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:20.04
from an exercise file
for the Angular project,

11
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:22.01
you'll have to take an extra step.

12
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:24.02
Let's begin by opening
up the exercise file

13
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.01
inside Visual Studio Code.

14
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:29.02
So I'll open up 05_01.

15
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:31.05
And if it has a package.json file,

16
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:33.05
that means it has dependencies.

17
00:00:33.05 --> 00:00:39.01
So I'll use npm install to
install those dependencies.

18
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:41.06
And it's created a Node Modules folder

19
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:43.08
that contains all of the packages.

20
00:00:43.08 --> 00:00:45.09
Once it's finished, you
can continue developing

21
00:00:45.09 --> 00:00:47.08
or exploring the project.

22
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:49.03
Although these exercise files

23
00:00:49.03 --> 00:00:51.08
are available, I suggest using them only

24
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:54.00
as a reference if you get stuck.

25
00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:55.03
I highly suggest creating everything

26
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:57.02
from start to finish as you follow along

27
00:00:57.02 --> 00:01:00.01
in the course, as practice makes perfect.
