00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.02
- [Instructor] We have
our try and catch blocks,

2
00:00:02.02 --> 00:00:04.08
and the third optional
part is the finally block.

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:06.09
This gets executed regardless if

4
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:09.03
the try catch block fails or passes.

5
00:00:09.03 --> 00:00:16.01
For now let's add the finally
block to our app.post.

6
00:00:16.01 --> 00:00:17.03
There are some cases in which

7
00:00:17.03 --> 00:00:19.05
you would want to use a finally block,

8
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:22.00
but in most cases you're probably just

9
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:24.03
going to end up using try and catch.

10
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.06
An example could be if you're
submitting something to a log.

11
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:40.06
So, in our case, if we had a logger

12
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:42.02
we could add an entry that the

13
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:44.09
message post end point was called,

14
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:48.08
or if you're using a resource
that you need to shut down,

15
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:50.09
for example, in the case of a database

16
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:53.06
you might open a
connection, post something,

17
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:56.06
and then you might have to
close it in the finally.

18
00:00:56.06 --> 00:00:57.09
For now, just so we can explore the

19
00:00:57.09 --> 00:00:59.05
concept of the finally block,

20
00:00:59.05 --> 00:01:02.06
I'll change this into a console.log.

21
00:01:02.06 --> 00:01:04.03
Then let's open up our Terminal.

22
00:01:04.03 --> 00:01:09.02
And now let's try posting a new message.

23
00:01:09.02 --> 00:01:10.07
Let's go look at our Terminal,

24
00:01:10.07 --> 00:01:12.00
and we can see that we're getting our

25
00:01:12.00 --> 00:01:16.09
message post called console.log.

26
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:20.05
Next, let's add a throw
at the top of our try

27
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:22.06
to trigger our catch,

28
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:26.04
and make our try catch block fail.

29
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:29.06
And now let's try posting again.

30
00:01:29.06 --> 00:01:32.09
We get our internal
server error 500 response,

31
00:01:32.09 --> 00:01:34.06
and back in our Terminal we can see that

32
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:37.01
the finally block is still executed,

33
00:01:37.01 --> 00:01:40.05
and we're getting our message
post called console.log.
