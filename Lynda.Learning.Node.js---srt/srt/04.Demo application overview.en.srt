1
00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:03.03
- In this course we'll be
creating a demo chat application.

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:06.04
It will feature HTTP requests
made from the front end

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:07.03
to the back end,

4
00:00:07.03 --> 00:00:10.03
as well as web sockets through Socket.IO,

5
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:12.06
which will allow for
automatic push notifications

6
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:14.07
from the server to the client.

7
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:16.07
So let's take a look at that.

8
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:19.06
So I can post a new message

9
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:23.05
and it will automatically
show up in my client,

10
00:00:23.05 --> 00:00:30.05
but in the second client as well,

11
00:00:30.05 --> 00:00:32.06
and vice versa.

12
00:00:32.06 --> 00:00:34.07
In fact, we can open up as
many clients as we like,

13
00:00:34.07 --> 00:00:47.08
and it will scale.

14
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:50.05
We can even restart our clients,

15
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:52.04
and the data will still show.

16
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:58.02
And we'll be using MongoDB and
mLab to make our data persist

17
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:00.03
Most of the node concepts will be taught

18
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:02.02
by developing this app.

19
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:05.00
While a few of the more
fundamental concepts will be taught

20
00:01:05.00 --> 00:01:07.09
through separate programming lessons.
