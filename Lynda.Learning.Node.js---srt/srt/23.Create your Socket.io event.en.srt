00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.06
- [Instructor] Let's submit an event

2
00:00:01.06 --> 00:00:03.04
from the server to all clients

3
00:00:03.04 --> 00:00:05.08
notifying them of a new message.

4
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:08.08
We can do this in our post
message endpoint function.

5
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:11.07
Let's scroll to that on line 20.

6
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:17.02
And below line 21, let's add io.emit,

7
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:21.08
and we'll call our event message.

8
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:23.07
And we'll pass the request.body,

9
00:00:23.07 --> 00:00:25.06
which will contain the message.

10
00:00:25.06 --> 00:00:26.09
Let's save that.

11
00:00:26.09 --> 00:00:31.00
Then on our front end, then
let's open up our index.html.

12
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:34.03
And on our front end, we need
to add an event listener.

13
00:00:34.03 --> 00:00:37.03
So let's scroll down
to our script section.

14
00:00:37.03 --> 00:00:42.06
Then below our document
ready, we'll add socket.on,

15
00:00:42.06 --> 00:00:44.09
and we'll check for the message event,

16
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:51.08
and we'll simply call add message.

17
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:54.05
And I'll rename this to add message

18
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:57.01
since we're only adding a single message.

19
00:00:57.01 --> 00:00:59.03
And notice that I've
supplied just the name of

20
00:00:59.03 --> 00:01:01.05
our add message function.

21
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:04.08
Since its signature matches
that exactly of the callback

22
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:10.02
that we'd need to supply
with our socket.on call.

23
00:01:10.02 --> 00:01:14.01
Let's give it a try after saving.

24
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:20.06
So I'll refresh, and
let's post a new message.

25
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:22.03
It seems to work fine with one client.

26
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:25.00
Now let's try two.

27
00:01:25.00 --> 00:01:31.00
So I'll duplicate this tab.

28
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:34.02
And I'll post a message
from the second client,

29
00:01:34.02 --> 00:01:36.01
and let's check the first.

30
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:38.09
And you can see that
it instantly shows up.

31
00:01:38.09 --> 00:01:41.06
It's fairly straightforward
with socket.io.

32
00:01:41.06 --> 00:01:44.03
Notice though, every time
we restart our server,

33
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:46.08
we lose all of our message history.

34
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:48.00
Let's fix that.

35
00:01:48.00 --> 00:01:50.08
We could do that with file
write and read functionality

36
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:53.00
that we learned in an earlier chapter,

37
00:01:53.00 --> 00:01:55.09
but a much better solution
would be to store our messages

38
00:01:55.09 --> 00:01:57.03
in a database.

39
00:01:57.03 --> 00:01:59.01
Let's look at that next.
