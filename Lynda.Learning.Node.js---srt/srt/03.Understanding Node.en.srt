1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:01.06
- [Instructor] Node is an open-source,

2
00:00:01.06 --> 00:00:03.07
cross-platform runtime environment

3
00:00:03.07 --> 00:00:06.07
for service-side and
networking applications.

4
00:00:06.07 --> 00:00:08.08
It's built on top of Chrome's JavaScript

5
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:11.03
runtime, the V8 engine.

6
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:15.04
And so applications for Node
are written in JavaScript.

7
00:00:15.04 --> 00:00:17.04
This is why many developers like Node,

8
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:18.08
because it's lightweight and you can write

9
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:21.07
your front-end and backend
in the same language.

10
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:23.08
But we'll cover more on that later.

11
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:26.03
If we head over to nodejs.org,

12
00:00:26.03 --> 00:00:29.01
we can see the different
sections we have access to.

13
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:31.08
And one in particular
you might find useful.

14
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:35.08
In the top navigation, let's
go ahead and click on Docs.

15
00:00:35.08 --> 00:00:39.05
And then let's click on
Docs for Version 8.6.0,

16
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:41.02
or the latest version.

17
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:42.04
Here, we'll be able to see all

18
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:44.07
the systems available to Node.

19
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:46.07
So if you ever run into any problems,

20
00:00:46.07 --> 00:00:49.03
or would like to know
the parameters needed

21
00:00:49.03 --> 00:00:51.08
for a function, such as the file system,

22
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:53.09
which we'll be using later in this course,

23
00:00:53.09 --> 00:00:56.03
the API docs is a great
place to learn more

24
00:00:56.03 --> 00:01:00.00
about the systems and
modules Node has to offer.
