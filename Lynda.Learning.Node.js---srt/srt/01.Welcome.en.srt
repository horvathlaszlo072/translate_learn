00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:03.00
- [Alexander] Hi, my
name is Alexander Zanfir.

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:04.03
In this course, we will cover

3
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:07.04
all you need to know to
start developing with Node.

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:09.07
The course will start
off at a beginner level

5
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:12.00
and slowly work up to
more advanced topics.

6
00:00:12.00 --> 00:00:15.09
This course is an update to
the 2015 original version

7
00:00:15.09 --> 00:00:17.06
and will cover new features of Node,

8
00:00:17.06 --> 00:00:20.07
such as async/await, as
well as greater focus

9
00:00:20.07 --> 00:00:23.09
on introducing popular
web development concepts.

10
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:26.01
We will be building a
demo chat application

11
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.01
from start to finish
and you will be guided

12
00:00:28.01 --> 00:00:30.00
through all the code we write,

13
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.07
so prior programming experience

14
00:00:31.07 --> 00:00:34.00
is not required, but suggested.

15
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:36.06
We'll get started by introducing Node.
