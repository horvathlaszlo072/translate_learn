00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:02.04
- [Instructor] Socket.io
enables real time,

2
00:00:02.04 --> 00:00:05.03
bidirectional, event based communication.

3
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:07.08
Express on the other
hand allows the client

4
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:09.08
to send a request to the server,

5
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:12.02
but the server cannot
send request to the client

6
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:16.02
and so it does not have
bidirectional communication.

7
00:00:16.02 --> 00:00:17.06
Socket.io solves this.

8
00:00:17.06 --> 00:00:20.03
In other words, we can push notifications

9
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:22.05
from the server to the client

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.07
when an event happens,
as well as other data.

11
00:00:25.07 --> 00:00:28.09
We will see how this works
eventually with our demo app.

12
00:00:28.09 --> 00:00:33.00
Socket.io has two parts,
a client side library

13
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:34.06
that runs on the browser,

14
00:00:34.06 --> 00:00:37.01
and a server side library for node.js.

15
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:41.01
Both components have an API
that's nearly identical.

16
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:44.03
And just like node.js, it is event driven.

17
00:00:44.03 --> 00:00:46.00
Now that we've had a brief intro

18
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:49.04
into some of the most popular
web frameworks for node,

19
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:52.00
let's go ahead and create
the demo application

20
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:53.04
utilizing them.

21
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:55.04
Let's look at that next.
