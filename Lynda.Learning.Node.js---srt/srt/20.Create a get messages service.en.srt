1
00:00:00.01 --> 00:00:01.04
- [Instructor] Let's begin by creating

2
00:00:01.04 --> 00:00:04.01
a getMessages service endpoint, and note,

3
00:00:04.01 --> 00:00:06.05
this will allow us to get actual messages

4
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:11.02
from our backend to our front-end website.

5
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:15.04
Inside our server.js, let's
add a route for our endpoint.

6
00:00:15.04 --> 00:00:18.02
We will be using app.get to specify that

7
00:00:18.02 --> 00:00:20.06
we will be handling GET requests.

8
00:00:20.06 --> 00:00:24.01
So between line four and
five, let's add a few lines,

9
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:28.01
so that we can make room for app.get.

10
00:00:28.01 --> 00:00:29.08
Then for the first parameter,

11
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:31.04
we need to specify the route.

12
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:34.05
We'll use /messages, since we'll be

13
00:00:34.05 --> 00:00:36.05
supplying a list of messages.

14
00:00:36.05 --> 00:00:40.03
And then we'll need our
callback to handle the request.

15
00:00:40.03 --> 00:00:43.06
That will take in request,
and then give us reference

16
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:47.07
to response, so that we can respond to it.

17
00:00:47.07 --> 00:00:50.07
For now, let's respond with a
test string that says hello.

18
00:00:50.07 --> 00:00:52.07
So we'll use response

19
00:00:52.07 --> 00:00:55.00
dot send

20
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:57.04
and then a string that says hello.

21
00:00:57.04 --> 00:00:59.08
We can try this out in
our browser by navigating

22
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:04.00
to the endpoint with a /messages.

23
00:01:04.00 --> 00:01:07.01
And then we can see the string hello.

24
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.07
Next, let's create a
placeholder messages list

25
00:01:09.07 --> 00:01:15.03
as an array at the top.

26
00:01:15.03 --> 00:01:17.07
We will call it messages,
and then we'll create

27
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:31.01
two message objects,
with a name and message.

28
00:01:31.01 --> 00:01:33.05
Then I'll copy this, add a comma,

29
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:37.04
and add the second message object.

30
00:01:37.04 --> 00:01:42.00
Then change the name and the message.

31
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:44.04
Now we can update our
messages and point to send

32
00:01:44.04 --> 00:01:49.01
that messages array instead
of the hello string.

33
00:01:49.01 --> 00:01:54.01
Let's save that and refresh our browser.

34
00:01:54.01 --> 00:01:57.00
And you can see that we're
getting the messages array.

35
00:01:57.00 --> 00:01:59.05
Next, let's go back to our index html

36
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:02.01
and update our front
end, so that we actually

37
00:02:02.01 --> 00:02:04.03
get those messages from the backend,

38
00:02:04.03 --> 00:02:07.03
using an http ajax request.

39
00:02:07.03 --> 00:02:09.07
Let's go down to our script element,

40
00:02:09.07 --> 00:02:12.02
and add a new function below our last.

41
00:02:12.02 --> 00:02:13.07
We'll call it

42
00:02:13.07 --> 00:02:18.05
getMessages.

43
00:02:18.05 --> 00:02:23.01
Inside here, let's make a
jQuery http GET request.

44
00:02:23.01 --> 00:02:26.00
We'll use $.get.

45
00:02:26.00 --> 00:02:28.03
And then we'll need the
URL from our browser.

46
00:02:28.03 --> 00:02:31.02
So let's copy that.

47
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:33.08
And paste that in.

48
00:02:33.08 --> 00:02:36.03
And of course, we'll need a callback

49
00:02:36.03 --> 00:02:40.03
that provides us with our data.

50
00:02:40.03 --> 00:02:42.06
So we'll supply that
as a second parameter.

51
00:02:42.06 --> 00:02:44.08
Now, let's console log the data

52
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:46.09
to make sure that this step works.

53
00:02:46.09 --> 00:02:49.06
And before we try this, let's call our

54
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:53.04
getMessages function and
our document ready function.

55
00:02:53.04 --> 00:02:58.00
So we'll add that below our click binding.

56
00:02:58.00 --> 00:03:00.02
Let's save that and give it a try.

57
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:04.00
Let's go back to our web
app, and then hit refresh.

58
00:03:04.00 --> 00:03:07.00
If we give this a try, we can
see that it will not work.

59
00:03:07.00 --> 00:03:09.05
It does not recognize
the jQuery GET function

60
00:03:09.05 --> 00:03:11.09
as we can see in our console error.

61
00:03:11.09 --> 00:03:14.09
That's because by default,
the jQuery CDN link

62
00:03:14.09 --> 00:03:18.02
we copied earlier, is
using a slim version.

63
00:03:18.02 --> 00:03:22.05
So let's remove that from the
URL in our script element.

64
00:03:22.05 --> 00:03:26.03
So let's scroll to the top, and
in the first script element,

65
00:03:26.03 --> 00:03:31.06
on line three, we can see
it contains a slim version.

66
00:03:31.06 --> 00:03:34.09
So I'll take out the word slim.

67
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:37.06
Since we're now using a
different version of jQuery,

68
00:03:37.06 --> 00:03:39.07
the integrity property
will no longer work,

69
00:03:39.07 --> 00:03:49.01
so we can take that out.

70
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:51.01
Then let's save that and give it a try.

71
00:03:51.01 --> 00:03:53.06
When we reload our app, we can see that

72
00:03:53.06 --> 00:03:58.08
we have our messages list in our console.

73
00:03:58.08 --> 00:04:01.06
Next, let's display these messages

74
00:04:01.06 --> 00:04:06.05
in the message area we created earlier.

75
00:04:06.05 --> 00:04:10.08
So let's scroll down and
get rid of the console log

76
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:14.04
on line 34 in our getMessages call.

77
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:16.08
And instead, we will
iterate through each message

78
00:04:16.08 --> 00:04:20.03
in our data, and call addMessage.

79
00:04:20.03 --> 00:04:24.04
We can do that with data.foreach.

80
00:04:24.04 --> 00:04:27.09
And that auto-generates
a forEach function for us

81
00:04:27.09 --> 00:04:32.02
with a callback, so we're
using just data.forEach.

82
00:04:32.02 --> 00:04:34.09
Then inside, we'll call addMessages,

83
00:04:34.09 --> 00:04:41.04
and supply the message
object as the argument.

84
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:45.07
Let's save that, and give it a try.

85
00:04:45.07 --> 00:04:48.05
So now as I refresh, our list populates

86
00:04:48.05 --> 00:04:50.08
our message history area.

87
00:04:50.08 --> 00:04:53.07
We can do a quick optimization.

88
00:04:53.07 --> 00:04:56.08
Since the signature of
our addMessages function

89
00:04:56.08 --> 00:05:00.05
matches the signature of the
callback we're supplying,

90
00:05:00.05 --> 00:05:02.08
we don't need a callback at all.

91
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:05.04
We can simply call forEach and then supply

92
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:08.07
the name of our function, addMessages.

93
00:05:08.07 --> 00:05:12.01
And now our addMessages
function will be called directly

94
00:05:12.01 --> 00:05:16.00
instead of going through
an in-line callback.

95
00:05:16.00 --> 00:05:18.07
Let's save that and make
sure it still works.

96
00:05:18.07 --> 00:05:20.03
So I've refreshed the page,

97
00:05:20.03 --> 00:05:22.02
and both messages are still there.

98
00:05:22.02 --> 00:05:24.02
Now that we're able to get messages,

99
00:05:24.02 --> 00:05:27.08
next let's see how we
can post new messages.
