00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:01.08
- [Instructor] Let's
take a look at some of

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:03.09
the available frameworks for Node.

3
00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:05.06
But first, what is a framework?

4
00:00:05.06 --> 00:00:08.00
It's sometimes interesting
when we look at a definition

5
00:00:08.00 --> 00:00:09.05
in its generic form.

6
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:12.02
For example, a framework
is an essential supporting

7
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:15.03
structure of a building,
vehicle, or object.

8
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:18.03
And in software, it's
essentially the same thing.

9
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:19.06
It is a supporting structure

10
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:21.06
that allows you to build on top of it.

11
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:24.05
When it comes to web, and
we want to build large APIs,

12
00:00:24.05 --> 00:00:26.06
or maybe HTTP servers,

13
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:28.09
we can leverage web frameworks,

14
00:00:28.09 --> 00:00:30.09
and there are several
options we can look at.

15
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:32.09
Each of these provide
us with the structure

16
00:00:32.09 --> 00:00:35.02
and components you need
to quickly make serving

17
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:38.04
static files, like
traditional websites, easy.

18
00:00:38.04 --> 00:00:42.01
Or we can put together a web
API to interact in a web app.

19
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:45.02
A web API is a service that
allows us to get and save data

20
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:46.07
to our server or back end,

21
00:00:46.07 --> 00:00:50.08
such as a web API that allows
us to maybe create users,

22
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:53.07
serve a list of users, et cetera.

23
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:55.06
Now let's take a look
at the different options

24
00:00:55.06 --> 00:00:58.01
we have for web frameworks for Node.

25
00:00:58.01 --> 00:00:59.08
We'll be looking at Express,

26
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:01.09
which is a very traditional framework.

27
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:03.02
It's tried and tested,

28
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:04.08
and it's simple to use.

29
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:07.01
The next framework we'll
look at is called Sails.

30
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:11.03
It has many sub-frameworks such as an ORM,

31
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:13.01
or object relational mapper,

32
00:01:13.01 --> 00:01:17.02
which gives us database access
and many other rich features.

33
00:01:17.02 --> 00:01:20.03
Then there is Koa, which is
the most modern framework.

34
00:01:20.03 --> 00:01:22.01
So let's go ahead and take
a look at each of these

35
00:01:22.01 --> 00:01:23.03
in more detail.
