00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.01
- [Instructor] Let's
summarize some of the benefits

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.01
and features of JavaScript.

3
00:00:04.01 --> 00:00:07.00
With Node, we get access
to sharing the language

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:09.01
between the back end and the front end,

5
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:10.05
and as well, sharing the code

6
00:00:10.05 --> 00:00:12.08
between the back end and the front end.

7
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:15.00
Another difference, and one that I like,

8
00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:17.08
is that JavaScript is a dynamic language,

9
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:20.03
meaning the type is determined by value,

10
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:22.04
not when the variable is declared.

11
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:25.02
It is loosely typed versus strongly typed.

12
00:00:25.02 --> 00:00:28.03
Another nice benefit is
that JSON comes naturally

13
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:31.03
to JavaScript, which makes
it ideal for web apps

14
00:00:31.03 --> 00:00:33.06
both on the front end and back end.

15
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:36.04
JSON stands for JavaScript
Object Notation,

16
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:39.05
and it's based on a subset
of the JavaScript language.

17
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:42.03
A good example is passing
data from our back end

18
00:00:42.03 --> 00:00:43.04
to our front end.

19
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:46.00
In other environments
with different languages,

20
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:48.03
you would have to do
some sort of conversion.

21
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:50.06
With JavaScript it's much easier.

22
00:00:50.06 --> 00:00:52.08
Overall, JavaScript has many pros,

23
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:54.05
but these can be seen as cons

24
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:56.04
depending on the circumstance.

25
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:59.03
JavaScript is definitely
not the ultimate solution,

26
00:00:59.03 --> 00:01:01.07
but sharing JavaScript
between your front end

27
00:01:01.07 --> 00:01:03.07
and back end makes web app development

28
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:05.03
that much more fun.
