1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.03
- [Instructor] Let's
continue by installing node.

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:04.05
Head over to nodejs.org

3
00:00:04.05 --> 00:00:08.02
and then in the top navigation
bar select downloads.

4
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:11.03
If you see an option
between LTS and current,

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:13.01
select current so that
we get the latest version

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:17.00
and at the time of this
production, it's version 8.6.

7
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:19.00
Then download the installer
for the operating system

8
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:20.04
which makes sense for you.

9
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:23.03
Afterwards, let's go ahead
and start the installer.

10
00:00:23.03 --> 00:00:25.01
Once the installer initializes,

11
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:28.04
let's go through the different sections.

12
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:30.01
We'll accept the terms.

13
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:32.05
Leave the default installation directory.

14
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.05
And leave the default features enabled.

15
00:00:35.05 --> 00:00:38.08
Then I'll hit install.

16
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:41.05
Since I'm updating node on my end,

17
00:00:41.05 --> 00:00:44.04
the status might have
looked slightly different.

18
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:45.05
I'll hit finish.

19
00:00:45.05 --> 00:00:48.05
And now let's test that node
has successfully installed

20
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.08
by opening up your
terminal or command prompt.

21
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:54.05
So I've launched the
command prompt on Windows

22
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:58.00
and I'll type in node dash v for version.

23
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:01.08
And as we can see, it's
the correct version 8.6.

24
00:01:01.08 --> 00:01:03.07
If this is still not working for you,

25
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:05.09
you can go ahead and restart your computer

26
00:01:05.09 --> 00:01:07.09
and give it another shot.
